<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A CROSSED TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>The tenderfoot rose from the ledge upon
which he had been lying and stretched
himself stiffly. The chill of the long night
had set him shivering. His bones ached from the
pressure of his body upon the rock where he had
slept and waked and dozed again with troubled
dreams. The sharpness of his hunger made him
light-headed. Thirst tortured him. His throat
was a lime-kiln, his tongue swollen till it filled his
mouth.</p>
<p>If the night had been bad, he knew the day would
be a hundred times worse. Already a gray light
was sifting into the hollow of the sky. The vague
misty outlines of the mountains were growing
sharper. Soon from a crotch of them would rise
a red hot cannon ball to pour its heat into the
parched desert.</p>
<p>He was headed for the Sonora line, for the hills
where he had heard a man might drop out of sight
of the civilization that had once known him. There
were reasons why he had started in a hurry, without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
a horse or food or a canteen, and these same
reasons held good why he could not follow beaten
tracks. All yesterday he had traveled without
sighting a ranch or meeting a human being. But
he knew he must get to water soon&mdash;if he were
to reach it at all.</p>
<p>A light breeze was stirring, and on it there was
borne to him a faint rumble as of thunder. Instantly
the man came to a rigid alertness. Thunder
might mean rain, and rain would be salvation.
But the sound did not die away. Instead, it deepened
to a steady roar, growing every instant louder.
His startled glance swept the cañon that drove like
a sword cleft into the hills. Pouring down it, with
the rush of a tidal wave, came a wall of cattle, a
thousand backs tossing up and down as the swell
of a troubled sea. Though he had never seen one
before, the man on the lip of the gulch knew that
he was watching a cattle stampede. Under the impact
of the galloping hoofs the ground upon which
he stood quaked.</p>
<p>A cry diverted his attention. From the bed of
the sandy wash a man had started up and was running
for his life toward the cañon walls. Before
he had taken half a dozen steps the avalanche was
upon him, had cut him down, swept over him.</p>
<p>The thud of the hoofs died away. Into the open
desert the stampede had passed. A huddled mass
lay motionless on the sand in the track of the avalanche.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>A long ragged breath whistled through the closed
lips of the tenderfoot. He ran along the edge of
the rock wall till he found a descent less sharp,
lowered himself by means of jutting quartz and
mesquit cropping out from the crevices, and so
came through a little draw to the cañon.</p>
<p>He dropped on a knee beside the sprawling, huddled
figure. No second glance was needed to see
that the man was dead. Life had been trampled
out of him almost instantly and his features battered
beyond any possible recognition. Unused to
scenes of violence, the stranger stooping over him
felt suddenly sick. It made him shudder to remember
that if he could have found a way down
in the darkness he, too, would have slept in the
warm sand of the dry wash. If he had, the fate
of this man would have been his.</p>
<p>Under the doubled body was a canteen. The
trembling fingers of the tenderfoot unscrewed the
cork. Tipping the vessel, he drank avidly. One
swallow, a second, then a few trickling drops. The
canteen had been almost empty.</p>
<p>Uncovering, he stood bareheaded before the inert
body and spoke gently in the low, soft voice
one instinctively uses in the presence of the dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend, I couldn&#8217;t save your life, but your water
has saved mine, I reckon. Anyhow, it gives me
another chance to fight for it. I wish I could do
something for you ... carry a message to
your folks and tell them how it happened.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>He dropped down again beside the dead man and
rifled the pockets. In them he found two letters
addressed in an illiterate hand to James Diller,
Cananea, Sonora, Mexico. An idea flashed into his
brain and for a moment held him motionless while
he worked it out. Why not? This man was about
his size, dressed much like him, and so mutilated
that identification was impossible.</p>
<p>From his own pocket he took a leather bill book
and a monogrammed cigarcase. With a sharp stone
he scarred the former. The metal case he crushed
out of shape beneath the heel of his boot. Having
first taken one twenty dollar yellowback from the
well-padded book, he slipped it and the cigarcase
into the inner coat pocket of the dead man. Irregularly
in a dozen places he gashed with his knife
the derby hat he was wearing, ripped the band half
loose, dragged it in the dust, and jumped on it till
the hat was flat as a pancake. Finally he kicked
it into the sand a dozen yards away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cattle would get it tangled in their hoofs
and drag it that far with them,&#8221; he surmised.</p>
<p>The soft gray hat of the dead man he himself
appropriated. Again he spoke to the lifeless body,
lowering his voice to a murmur.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you wouldn&#8217;t grudge me this if you
knew. I&#8217;m up against it. If I get out of these
hills alive I&#8217;ll be lucky. But if I do&mdash;well, it won&#8217;t
do you any harm to be mistaken for me, and it
will accommodate me mightily. I hate to leave you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
here alone, but it&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got to do to save myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned away and plodded up the dry creek
bed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The sun was at the meridian when three heavily
armed riders drew up at the mouth of the cañon.
They fell into the restful, negligent postures of
horsemen accustomed to take their ease in the
saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you figure maybe he&#8217;s working up to the
headwaters of Dry Sandy?&#8221; one suggested.</p>
<p>A squat, bandy-legged man with a face of tanned
leather presently answered. &#8220;No, Tim, I expect not.
The way I size him up Mr. Richard Bellamy
wouldn&#8217;t know Dry Sandy from an irrigation ditch.
Mr. R. B. hopes he&#8217;s hittin&#8217; the high spots for
Sonora, but he ain&#8217;t anyways sure. Right about
now he&#8217;s ridin&#8217; the grub line, unless he&#8217;s made a
strike somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third member of the party, a lean, wide-shouldered,
sinewy youth, blue silk kerchief knotted
loosely around his neck, broke in with a gesture
that swept the sky. &#8220;Funny about all them buzzards.
What are they doing here, sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squat man opened his mouth to answer, but
Tim took the word out of his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; His arm had shot straight out toward
the cañon. A coyote was disappearing on the lope.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
&#8220;Something lying there in the wash at the bend,
Burke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sheriff Burke slid his rifle from its scabbard.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll not take any chances, boys. Spread out far
as you can. Tim, ride close to the left wall. You
keep along the right one, Flatray. Me, I&#8217;ll take the
center. That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode forward cautiously. Once Flatray
spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the tracks there has been a lot of cattle down
here on the jump recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what,&#8221; Tim agreed.</p>
<p>Flatray swung from his saddle and stooped over
the body lying at the bend of the wash.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crushed to death in a cattle stampede, looks
like,&#8221; he called to the sheriff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search him, Jack,&#8221; the sheriff ordered.</p>
<p>The young man gave an exclamation of surprise.
He was standing with a cigarcase in one hand and
a billbook in the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s the man we&#8217;re after&mdash;it&#8217;s
Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burke left his horse and came forward. &#8220;How
do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Initials on the cigarcase, R. B. Same monogram
on the billbook.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff had stooped to pick up a battered hat
as he moved toward the deputy. Now he showed
the initials stamped on the sweat band. &#8220;R. B.
here, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suit of gray clothes, derby hat, size and weight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
about medium. We&#8217;ll never know about the scar
on the eyebrow, but I guess Mr. Bellamy is identified
without that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have camped here last night and while
he was asleep the cattle stampeded down the cañon,&#8221;
Tim hazarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That guess is as good as any. They ce&#8217;tainly
stomped the life out of him thorough. Anyhow,
Bellamy has met up with his punishment. We&#8217;ll
have to pack the body back to town, boys,&#8221; the
sheriff told them.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the party filed out to the creosote
flats and struck across country toward Mesa.
Flatray was riding pillion behind Tim. His own
horse was being used as a pack saddle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>BRAND BLOTTING</h3>
</div>

<p>The tenderfoot, slithering down a hillside of
shale, caught at a greasewood bush and
waited. The sound of a rifle shot had
drifted across the ridge to him. Friend or foe, it
made no difference to him now. He had reached
the end of his tether, must get to water soon or
give up the fight.</p>
<p>No second shot broke the stillness. A swift zigzagged
across the cattle trail he was following.
Out of a blue sky the Arizona sun still beat down
upon a land parched by æons of drought, a land
still making its brave show of greenness against a
dun background.</p>
<p>Arrow straight the man made for the hill crest.
Weak as a starved puppy, his knees bent under him
as he climbed. Down and up again a dozen times,
he pushed feverishly forward. All day he had been
seeing things. Cool lakes had danced on the horizon
line before his tortured vision. Strange fancies
had passed in and out of his mind. He wondered
if this, too, were a delusion. How long that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
stiff ascent took him he never knew, but at last he
reached the summit and crept over its cactus-covered
shoulder.</p>
<p>He looked into a valley dressed in its young
spring garb. Of all deserts this is the loveliest
when the early rains have given rebirth to the hope
that stirs within its bosom once a year. But the
tenderfoot saw nothing of its pathetic promise, of
its fragile beauty so soon to be blasted. His sunken
eyes swept the scene and found at first only a desert
waste in which lay death.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lose,&#8221; he said to himself out loud.</p>
<p>With the words he gave up the long struggle and
sank to the ground. For hours he had been exhausted
to the limit of endurance, but the will to
live had kept him going. Now the driving force
within had run down. He would die where he lay.</p>
<p>Another instant, and he was on his feet again
eager, palpitant, tremulous. For plainly there had
come to him the bleating of a calf.</p>
<p>Moving to the left, he saw rising above the hill
brow a thin curl of smoke. A dozen staggering
steps brought him to the edge of a draw. There
in the hollow below, almost within a stone&#8217;s throw,
was a young woman bending over a fire. He tried
to call, but his swollen tongue and dry throat refused
the service. Instead, he began to run toward
her.</p>
<p>Beyond the wash was a dead cow. Not far from
it lay a calf on its side, all four feet tied together.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
From the fire the young woman took a red-hot running
iron and moved toward the little bleater.</p>
<p>The crackling of a twig brought her around as
a sudden tight rein does a high-strung horse. The
man had emerged from the prickly pears and was
close upon her. His steps dragged. The sag of
his shoulders indicated extreme fatigue. The dark
hollows beneath the eyes told of days of torment.</p>
<p>The girl stood before him slender and straight.
She was pale to the lips. Her breath came fast
and ragged as if she had been running.</p>
<p>Abruptly she shot her challenge at him. &#8220;Who
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Water,&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>One swift, searching look the girl gave him, then
&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she ordered, and was off into the mesquit
on the run. Three minutes later the tenderfoot
heard her galloping through the brush. With a
quick, tight rein she drew up, swung from the saddle
expertly as a <i>vaquero</i>, and began to untie a canteen
held by buckskin thongs to the side of the
saddle.</p>
<p>He drank long, draining the vessel to the last
drop.</p>
<p>From her saddle bags she brought two sandwiches
wrapped in oiled paper.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hungry, too, I expect,&#8221; she said, her eyes
shining with tender pity.</p>
<p>She observed that he did not wolf his food, voracious
though he was. While he ate she returned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
to the fire with the running iron and heaped live
coals around the end of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve had a pretty tough time of it,&#8221; she called
across to him gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been exactly a picnic, but I&#8217;m all right
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl liked the way he said it. Whatever else
he was&mdash;and already faint doubts were beginning
to stir in her&mdash;he was not a quitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were about all in,&#8221; she said, watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just about one little kick left in me,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>She busied herself over the fire inspecting the
iron. The man watched her curiously. What could
it mean? A cow killed wantonly, a calf bawling
with pain and fear, and this girl responsible for it.
The tenderfoot could not down the suspicion stirring
in his mind. He knew little of the cattle country.
But he had read books and had spent a week
in Mesa not entirely in vain. The dead cow with
the little stain of red down its nose pointed surely
to one thing. He was near enough to see a hole
in the forehead just above the eyes. Instinctively
his gaze passed to the rifle lying in the sand close
to his hand. Her back was still turned to him. He
leaned over, drew the gun to him, and threw out
an empty shell from the barrel.</p>
<p>At the click of the lever the girl swung around
upon him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; she demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>He put the rifle down hurriedly. &#8220;Just seeing
what make it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what make is it?&#8221; she flashed.</p>
<p>He was trapped. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t found out yet,&#8221; he
stammered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but you found out there was an empty shell
in it,&#8221; she retorted quickly.</p>
<p>Their eyes fastened. She was gray as ashes, but
she did not flinch. By chance he had stumbled upon
the crime of crimes in Cattleland, had caught a
rustler redhanded at work. Looking into the fine
face, nostrils delicately fashioned, eyes clear and
deep, the thing was scarce credible of her. Why,
she could not be a day more than twenty, and in
every line of her was the look of pride, of good
blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I happened to throw it out,&#8221; he apologized.</p>
<p>But she would have no evasion, would not let his
doubts sleep. There was superb courage in the
scornful ferocity with which she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happened! And I suppose you <i>happened</i> to notice
that the brand on the cow is a Bar Double G,
while that on the calf is different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t noticed that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of time to see it yet.&#8221; Then, with a
swift blaze of feeling, &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of pretending?
I know what you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know more than I do. My thoughts
don&#8217;t go any farther than this, that you have saved
my life and I&#8217;m grateful for it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know better. You think I&#8217;m a rustler. But
don&#8217;t say it. Don&#8217;t you dare say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brought up in an atmosphere of semi-barbaric
traditions, silken-strong, with instincts unwarped
by social pressure, she was what the sun and wind
and freedom of Arizona had made her, a poetic
creation far from commonplace. So he judged her,
and in spite of the dastardly thing she had done he
sensed an innate refinement strangely at variance
with the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I won&#8217;t,&#8221; he answered, with a faint
smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve got to pay for your sandwiches by
making yourself useful. I&#8217;m going to finish this
job.&#8221; She said it with an edge of self-scorn. He
guessed her furious with self-contempt.</p>
<p>Under her directions he knelt on the calf so as
to hold it steady while she plied the hot iron. The
odor of burnt hair and flesh was already acrid in
his nostrils. Upon the red flank F was written in
raw, seared flesh. He judged that the brand she
wanted was not yet complete. Probably the iron
had got too cold to finish the work, and she had
been forced to reheat it.</p>
<p>The little hand that held the running iron was
trembling. Looking up, the tenderfoot saw that she
was white enough to faint.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it. You&#8217;ll have to let me hold him
while you blur the brand,&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>They changed places. She set her teeth to it and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
held the calf steady, but the brander noticed that
she had to look away when the red-hot iron came
near the flesh of the victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blur the brand right out. Do it quick, please,&#8221;
she urged.</p>
<p>A sizzle of burning skin, a piteous wail from the
tortured animal, an acrid pungent odor, and the
thing was done. The girl got to her feet, quivering
like an aspen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a knife?&#8221; she asked faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut the rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>The calf staggered to all fours, shook itself together,
and went bawling to the dead mother.</p>
<p>The girl drew a deep breath. &#8220;They say it does
not hurt except while it is being done.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bleak eyes met hers stonily. &#8220;And of course
it will soon get used to doing without its mother.
That is a mere detail.&#8221;</p>
<p>A shudder went through her.</p>
<p>The whole thing was incomprehensible to him.
Why under heaven had she done it? How could
one so sensitive have done a wanton cruel thing
like this? Her reason he could not fathom. The
facts that confronted him were that she <i>had</i> done it,
and had meant to carry the crime through. Only
detection had changed her purpose.</p>
<p>She turned upon him, plainly sick of the whole
business. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get away from here. Where&#8217;s
your horse?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any. I started on foot and got lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Mammoth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharply her keen eyes fixed him. How could a
man have got lost near Mammoth and wandered
here? He would have had to cross the range, and
even a child would have known enough to turn back
into the valley where the town lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Day before yesterday.&#8221; He added after a moment:
&#8220;I was looking for a job.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took in the soft hands and the unweathered
skin of the dark face. &#8220;What sort of a job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>She must take him home with her, of course,
and feed and rest him. That went without saying.
But what after that? He knew too much to be
turned adrift with the story of what he had seen.
If she could get a hold on him&mdash;whether of fear
or of gratitude&mdash;so as to insure his silence, the
truth might yet be kept quiet. At least she could
try.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever ride the range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of work have you done?&#8221;</p>
<p>After a scarcely noticeable pause, &#8220;Clerical
work,&#8221; he answered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re from the East?&#8221; she suggested, her eyes
narrowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Melissy Lee,&#8221; she told him, watching
him very steadily.</p>
<p>Once more the least of pauses. &#8220;Mine is Diller&mdash;James
Diller.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny. I know another man of that
name. At least, I know him by sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who had called himself Diller grew
wary. &#8220;It&#8217;s a common enough name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. If I find you work at my father&#8217;s ranch
would you be too particular about what it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And your memory&mdash;is it inconveniently good?&#8221;
Her glance swept as by chance over the scene of
her recent operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a right good forgettery, too,&#8221; he assured
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not in the habit of talking much about
the things you see.&#8221; She put it in the form of a
statement, but the rising inflection indicated the interrogative.</p>
<p>His black eyes met hers steadily. &#8220;I can padlock
my mouth when it is necessary,&#8221; he answered, the
suggestion of a Southern drawl in his intonation.</p>
<p>She wanted an assurance more direct. &#8220;When
<i>you</i> think it necessary, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what I meant to say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come. One good turn deserves another. What
about this?&#8221; She nodded toward the dead cow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen a thing I ought not to have
seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see me blot a brand on that calf?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Can&#8217;t recall it at all, Miss
Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly her keen glance raked him again. Judged
by his clothes, he was one of the world&#8217;s ineffectives,
flotsam tossed into the desert by the wash of fate;
but there was that in the steadiness of his eye, in
the set of his shoulders, in the carriage of his lean-loined,
slim body that spoke of breeding. He was
no booze-fighting grubliner. Disguised though he
was in cheap slops, she judged him a man of parts.
He would do to trust, especially since she could not
help herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be going. You take my horse,&#8221; she
ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And let you walk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long since you have eaten?&#8221; she asked
brusquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;About seven minutes,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;But before that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then. Anybody can see you&#8217;re as weak
as a kitten. Do as I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t we both ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can as soon as we get across the pass. Until
then I&#8217;ll walk.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>Erect as a willow sapling, she took the hills with
an elastic ease that showed her deep-bosomed in
spite of her slenderness. The short corduroy riding
skirt and high-laced boots were made for use,
not grace, but the man in the saddle found even
in her manner of walking the charm of her direct,
young courage. Free of limb, as yet unconscious
of sex, she had the look of a splendid boy. The
descending sun was in her sparkling hair, on the
lank, undulating grace of her changing lines.</p>
<p>Active as a cat though it was, the cowpony found
the steep pass with its loose rubble hard going. Melissy
took the climb much easier. In the way she
sped through the mesquit, evading the clutch of the
cholla by supple dips to right and left, there was a
kind of pantherine litheness.</p>
<p>At the summit she waited for the horse to clamber
up the shale after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get down in your collar, you Buckskin,&#8221; she
urged, and when the pony was again beside her
petted the animal with little love pats on the nose.</p>
<p>Carelessly she flung at Diller a question. &#8220;From
what part of the East did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was on the spot promptly this time. &#8220;From
Keokuk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keokuk, Indiana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Iowa,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it Iowa?&#8221; He had sidestepped her little
trap, but she did not give up. &#8220;Just arrived?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been herding sheep for a month.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sheep-herding!&#8221; Her disdain implied that
if he were fit for nothing better than sheep-herding,
the West could find precious little use for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all I could get to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you say you wrangled Mary&#8217;s little
lamb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Catalinas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>Question and answer were tossed back and forth
lightly, but both were watching warily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Outfit?&#8221; he repeated, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Who were you working for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t remember his name. He was a Mexican.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have been one of the camps of Antonio
Valdez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only he runs his sheep in the Galiuros,&#8221; she
demurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it the Galiuros? Those Spanish names! I
can&#8217;t keep them apart in my mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed with hard, young cruelty. &#8220;It is
hard to remember what you never heard, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was on the rack. Tiny beads of perspiration
stood out on his forehead. But he got
a lip smile into working order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean, Miss Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better get your story more pat. I&#8217;ve
punched a dozen holes in it already. First you tell
me you are from the East, and even while you were
telling me I knew you were a Southerner from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
drawl. No man ever got lost from Mammoth.
You gave a false name. You said you had been
herding sheep, but you didn&#8217;t know what an outfit
is. You wobbled between the Galiuros and the
Catalinas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a native. I told you I couldn&#8217;t remember
Spanish names.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t necessary to tell me,&#8221; she countered
quickly. &#8220;A man that can&#8217;t recall even the name
of his boss!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not in the witness box, Miss Lee,&#8221; he told
her stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, but you&#8217;re liable to be soon, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In a cattle rustling case, I suppose you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; She went on with her indictment
of his story, though his thrust had brought the color
to her cheek. &#8220;When I offered you Antonio Valdez
for an employer you jumped at him. If you want
to know, he happens to be our herder. He doesn&#8217;t
own a sheep and never will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know all about it,&#8221; he said with obvious
sarcasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re not who you say you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you know who I am then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know or care. It&#8217;s none of my business.
But others may think it is theirs. You can&#8217;t be so
reckless with the truth without folks having notions.
If I were you I&#8217;d get a story that will hang together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a good detective. Maybe I could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
get you to invent one for me,&#8221; he suggested
maliciously.</p>
<p>Her indignation flashed. &#8220;I&#8217;m no such thing.
But I&#8217;m not quite a fool. A babe in arms wouldn&#8217;t
swallow that fairy tale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Awkward as her knowledge might prove, he
could not help admiring the resource and shrewdness
of the girl. She had virtually served notice
that if she had a secret that needed keeping so
had he.</p>
<p>They looked down over a desert green with bajadas,
prickly pears, and mesquit. To the right,
close to a spur of the hills, were the dwarfed houses
of a ranch. The fans of a windmill caught the sun
and flashed it back to the travelers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bar Double G. My father owns it,&#8221; Miss
Lee explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Your father owns it.&#8221; He reflected a moment
while he studied her. &#8220;Let&#8217;s understand each
other, Miss Lee. I&#8217;m not what I claim to be,
you say. We&#8217;ll put it that you have guessed right.
What do you intend to do about it? I&#8217;m willing to
be made welcome at the Bar Double G, but I don&#8217;t
want to be too welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So long as I remember not to remember what
I&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood burned in her cheeks beneath their
Arizona tan. She did not look at him. &#8220;If you
like to put it that way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>He counted it to her credit that she was ashamed
of the bargain in every honest fiber of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what they say I&#8217;ve done. You&#8217;ll keep
faith?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; she flung back
bitterly. &#8220;It&#8217;s none of my affair. I told you that
before. Men come out here for all sorts of reasons.
We don&#8217;t ask for a bill of particulars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll be right glad to go down to the Bar
Double G with you, and say thanks for the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had dismounted when they first reached the
pass. Now she swung to the saddle and he climbed
behind her. They reached presently one of the
nomadic trails of the cattle country which wander
leisurely around hills and over gulches along the
line of least resistance. This brought them to a
main traveled road leading to the ranch.</p>
<p>They rode in silence until the pasture fence was
passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What am I to tell them your name is?&#8221; she
asked stiffly.</p>
<p>He took his time to answer. &#8220;Tom Morse is a
good name, don&#8217;t you think? How would T. L.
Morse do?&#8221;</p>
<p>She offered no comment, but sat in front of him,
unresponsive as the sphinx. The rigor of her flat
back told him that, though she might have to keep
his shameful secret for the sake of her own, he
could not presume upon it the least in the world.</p>
<p>Melissy turned the horse over to a little Mexican
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
boy and they were just mounting the steps of the
porch when a young man cantered up to the house.
Lean and muscular and sunbaked, he looked out
of cool, gray eyes upon a man&#8217;s world that had
often put him through the acid test. The plain,
cactus-torn chaps, flannel shirt open at the sinewy
throat, dusty, wide-brimmed hat, revolver peeping
from its leather pocket on the thigh: every detail
contributed to the impression of efficiency he created.
Even the one touch of swagger about him, the blue
silk kerchief knotted loosely around his neck, lent
color to his virile competency.</p>
<p>He dragged his horse to a standstill and leaped
off at the same instant. &#8220;Evenin&#8217;, &#8217;Lissie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was busy lacing her shoe and did not look
up. He guessed that he was being snubbed and
into his eyes came a gleam of fun. A day later
than he had promised, Jack Flatray was of opinion
that he was being punished for tardiness.</p>
<p>Casually he explained. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t make it any
sooner. Burke had a hurry-up job that took us
into the hills. Fellow by the name of Bellamy,
wanted for murder at Nemo, Arkansas, had been
tracked to Mesa. A message came over the wires
to arrest him. When Burke sent me to his room
he had lit out, taken a swift hike into the hills.
Must a-had some warning, for he didn&#8217;t even wait
for a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dilated eyes of the girl went past the deputy
to the man she had rescued. He was leaning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
against one of the porch posts, tense and rigid, on
his face the look of the hunted brought to bay.</p>
<p>&#8220;And did you find him?&#8221; she asked mechanically
of the deputy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found him. He had been trampled to death
by a cattle stampede.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mind groped blindly for an explanation.
Her woman&#8217;s instinct told her that the man panting
on the porch within six feet of the officer was
the criminal wanted. There must be a mistake
somewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you identify him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there is no doubt about it. His papers
and belongings all showed he was our man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; The excitement of his news had for a
moment thawed her, but a dignified aloofness
showed again in her manner. &#8220;If you want to see
father you&#8217;ll find him in the corral, Mr. Flatray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as I&#8217;m looking for him awful
hard,&#8221; the blue kerchiefed youth smiled genially.
&#8220;Anyway, I can wait a few minutes if I have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; She turned away indifferently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
show you your room, Mr. Morse.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy watched them disappear into the
house with astonishment printed on his face. He
had ridden twenty-seven miles to see Melissy Lee
and he had not quite expected this sort of a greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that don&#8217;t beat the Dutch. Looks like I&#8217;ll
do my callin&#8217; on the old man after all, maybe,&#8221; he
murmured with a grin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN ACCUSATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The rescued man ate, drank, and from sheer
fatigue fell asleep within five minutes of
the time he was shown his bedroom.</p>
<p>Since he was not of the easily discouraged kind,
the deputy stayed to supper on invitation of Lee.
He sat opposite the daughter of his host, and that
young woman treated him with the most frigid
politeness. The owner of the Bar Double G was
quite unaware of any change of temperature. Jack
and his little girl had always been the best of friends.
So now he discoursed on the price of cows, the
good rains, the outrages of the rustlers, and kindred
topics without suspecting that the attention of
the young man was on more personal matters.</p>
<p>Though born in Arizona, Melissy was of the
South. Due westward rolls the tide of settlement,
and Beauchamp Lee had migrated from Tennessee
after the war, following the line of least resistance
to the sunburned territory. Later he had married
a woman a good deal younger than himself. She
had borne him two children, the elder of whom was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
now a young man. Melissy was the younger, and
while she was still a babe in arms the mother had
died of typhoid and left her baby girl to grow up
as best she might in a land where women were few
and far. This tiny pledge of her mother&#8217;s love
Champ Lee had treasured as a gift from Heaven.
He had tended her and nursed her through the ailments
of childhood with a devotion the most pure
of his reckless life. Given to heady gusts of passion,
there had never been a moment when his voice
had been other than gentle and tender to her.</p>
<p>Inevitably Melissy had become the product of her
inheritance and her environment. If she was the
heiress of Beauchamp Lee&#8217;s courage and generosity,
his quick indignation against wrong and injustice,
so, too, she was of his passionate lawlessness.</p>
<p>After supper Melissy disappeared. She wanted
very much to be alone and have a good cry. Wherefore
she slipped out of the back door and ran up
the Lone Tree trail in the darkness. Jack thought
he saw a white skirt fly a traitorous signal, and at
leisure he pursued.</p>
<p>But Melissy was not aware of that. She reached
Lone Tree rock and slipped down from boulder
to boulder until she came to the pine which gave
the place its name. For hours she had been forced
to repress her emotions, to make necessary small
talk, to arrange for breakfast and other household
details. Now she was alone, and the floods of her
bitterness were unloosed. She broke down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
wept passionately, for she was facing her first great
disillusionment. She had lost a friend, one in whom
she had put great faith.</p>
<p>The first gust of the storm was past when Melissy
heard a step on the rocks above. She knew intuitively
that Jack Flatray had come in search of her,
and he was the last man on earth she wanted to
meet just now.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lissie!&#8221; she heard him call softly; and again,
&#8220;&#8217;Lissie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Noiselessly she got to her feet, waiting to see
what he would do. She knew he must be standing
on the edge of the great rock, so directly above her
that if he had kicked a pebble it would have landed
beside her. Presently he began to clamber down.</p>
<p>She tiptoed along the ledge and slipped into the
trough at the farther end that led to the top. It
was a climb she had taken several times, but never
in the dark. The ascent was almost perpendicular,
and it had to be made by clinging to projecting
rocks and vegetation. Moreover, if she were to escape
undetected it had to be done in silence.</p>
<p>She was a daughter of the hills, as surefooted
as a mountain goat. Handily she went up, making
the most of the footholds that offered. In spite
of the best she could do the rustling of bushes betrayed
her.</p>
<p>Jack came to the foot of the trough and looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re there, are you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Her foot loosened a stone and sent it rolling down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If I were you I wouldn&#8217;t try that at night,
&#8217;Liss,&#8221; he advised.</p>
<p>She made sure of the steadiness of her voice before
she answered. &#8220;You don&#8217;t need to try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said if I were you, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not. Don&#8217;t let me detain you here,
Mr. Flatray,&#8221; she told him in a manner of icy precision.</p>
<p>The deputy began the climb too. &#8220;What&#8217;s the
use of being so hostile, little girl?&#8221; he drawled.
&#8220;Me, I came as soon as I could, burning the wind,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She set her teeth, determined to reach the top
in time to get away before he could join her. In
her eagerness she took a chance that proved her undoing.
A rock gave beneath her foot and clattered
down. Clinging by one hand and foot, she felt her
body swing around. From her throat a little cry
leaped. She knew herself slipping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>In time, and just in time, he reached her, braced
himself, and gave her his knee for a foot rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right?&#8221; he asked, and &#8220;All right!&#8221; she answered
promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go back,&#8221; he told her.</p>
<p>She made no protest. Indeed, she displayed a
caution in lowering herself that surprised him.
Every foothold she tested carefully with her weight.
Once she asked him to place her shoe in the crevice
for her. He had never seen her take so much time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
in making sure or be so fussy about her personal
safety.</p>
<p>Safely on the ledge again, she attempted a second
time to dismiss him. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Flatray.
I won&#8217;t take any more of your time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily before he spoke.
&#8220;You&#8217;re mighty high-heeled, &#8217;Lissie. You know
my name ain&#8217;t Mr. Flatray to you. What&#8217;s it all
about? I&#8217;ve told you twice I couldn&#8217;t get here any
sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flamed out at him in an upblaze of feminine
ferocity. &#8220;And I tell <i>you</i>, that I don&#8217;t care if you
had never come. I don&#8217;t want to see you or have
anything to do with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; He asked it quietly, though he began
to know that her charge against him was a
serious one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I know what you are now, because you
have made us believe in you while all the time you
were living a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was gathering poppies on the other side of
Antelope Pass this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has that got to do with me being a liar
and a scoundrel,&#8221; he wanted to know.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you pretend,&#8221; she scoffed. &#8220;But you know
as well as I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s have the indictment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If everybody in Papago County had told me
I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
see it with my own eyes before I could have been
convinced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, well what is it you saw with your eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t keep it up. I tell you I saw it all
from the time you fired the shot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed easily, but without mirth. &#8220;Kept tab
on me, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She wheeled from him, gave a catch of her
breath, and caught at the rock wall to save herself
from falling.</p>
<p>He spoke sharply. &#8220;You hurt yourself in the
trough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sprained my ankle a little, but it doesn&#8217;t
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He understood now why she had made so slow
a descent and he suspected that the wrench was
more than she admitted. The moon had come out
from under a cloud and showed him a pale, tear-stained
face, with a row of even, little teeth set
firm against the lower lip. She was in pain and
her pride was keeping it from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me look at your ankle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I say yes. You&#8217;ve hurt it seriously.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is my business, I think,&#8221; she told him with
cold finality.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make it mine. Think I don&#8217;t know
you, proud as Lucifer when you get set. You&#8217;ll
lame yourself for life if you&#8217;re not careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care to discuss it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Fiddlesticks! If you&#8217;ve got anything against
me we&#8217;ll hear what it is afterward. Right now we&#8217;ll
give first aid to the injured. Sit down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had not meant to give way, but she did. Perhaps
it was because of the faintness that stole over
her, or because the pain was sharper than she could
well endure. She found herself seated on the rock
shelf, letting him cut the lace out of her shoe and
slip it off. Ever so gently he worked, but he could
tell by the catches of her breath that it was not
pleasant to endure. From his neck he untied the
silk kerchief and wrapped it tightly around the
ankle.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will have to do till I get you home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not trouble you, sir. If you&#8217;ll stop and tell
my father that is all I&#8217;ll ask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different here,&#8221; he retorted cheerfully. &#8220;Just so
as to avoid any argument, I&#8217;ll announce right now
that Jack Flatray is going to see you home. It&#8217;s
his say-so.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose. None knew better than she that he was
a dominating man when he chose to be. She herself
carried in her slim body a spirit capable of passion
and of obstinacy, but to-night she had not the
will to force the fighting.</p>
<p>Setting her teeth, she took a step or two forward,
her hand against the rock wall to help bear the
weight. With narrowed eyes, he watched her
closely, noting the catches of pain that shot through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
her breathing. Half way up the boulder bed he interposed
brusquely.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is plumb foolishness, girl. You&#8217;ve got no
business putting your weight on that foot, and
you&#8217;re not going to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slipped his arm around her waist in such a
way as to support her all he could. With a quick
turn of the body she tried to escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use. I&#8217;m going through with this, &#8217;Lissie.
Someone has been lying to you about me, and just
now you hate the ground I walk on. Good enough.
That&#8217;s got nothing to do with this. You&#8217;re a woman
that needs help, and any old time J. F. meets up
with such a one he&#8217;s on the job. You don&#8217;t owe
me &#8217;Thank you,&#8217; but you&#8217;ve got to stand for me till
you reach the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re taking advantage of me because I can&#8217;t
help myself. Why don&#8217;t you go and bring father,&#8221;
she flung out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m younger than your father and abler to help.
That&#8217;s why?&#8221;</p>
<p>They reached the top of the bluff and he made
her sit down to rest. A pale moon suffused the
country, and in that stage set to lowered lights her
pallor was accented. From the colorless face shadowy,
troubled eyes spoke the misery through which
she was passing. The man divined that her pain
was more than physical, and the knowledge went
to him poignantly by the heart route.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, &#8217;Lissie? What have I done?&#8221; he
asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know. I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of keeping it up? I caught you
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught me doing what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Caught you rustling, caught you branding a
calf just after you had shot the cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant her charge struck him dumb. He
stared at her as if he thought she had gone suddenly
mad.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? Say it again,&#8221; he got out at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the cow had the Bar Double G brand, belonged
to my father, your best friend,&#8221; she added
passionately.</p>
<p>He spoke very gently, but there was an edge to
his voice that was new to her. &#8220;Suppose you tell
me all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She threw out a hand in a gesture of despair.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? Nothing could have made me believe
it but my own eyes. You needn&#8217;t keep up a
pretense. I saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so you said before. Now begin at the
start and tell your story.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had the odd feeling of being put on the defensive
and it angered her. How dared he look at
her with those cool, gray eyes that still appeared to
bore a hole through treachery? Why did her heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
convict her of having deserted a friend, when she
knew that the desertion was his?</p>
<p>&#8220;While I was gathering poppies I heard a shot.
It was so close I walked to the edge of the draw
and looked over. There I saw you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was I doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were hogtying a calf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand at first. I thought to slip
down and surprise you for fun. But as I got lower
I saw the dead cow. Just then you began to brand
the calf and I cried out to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what you did,&#8221; she answered wearily.
&#8220;You broke for the brush where your horse was
and galloped away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a right good look at me, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at your face. But I knew. You were wearing
this blue silk handkerchief.&#8221; Her finger indicated
the one bound around her ankle.</p>
<p>&#8220;So on that evidence you decide I&#8217;m a rustler,
and you&#8217;ve only known me thirteen years. You&#8217;re
a good friend, &#8217;Lissie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes blazed on him like live coals. &#8220;Have
you forgotten the calf you left with your brand
on it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had startled him at last. &#8220;With my brand
on it?&#8221; he repeated, his voice dangerously low and
soft.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know as well as I do. You had got the F
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
just about finished when I called. You dropped
the running iron and ran.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dropped it and ran, did I? And what did
you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reheated the iron and blurred the brand so
that nobody could tell what it had been.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed harshly without mirth. &#8220;I see. I&#8217;m
a waddy and a thief, but you&#8217;re going to protect
me for old times&#8217; sake. That&#8217;s the play, is it? I
ought to be much obliged to you and promise to
reform, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bitterness stung. She felt a tightening of the
throat. &#8220;All I ask is that you go away and never
come back to me,&#8221; she cried with a sob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that. I ain&#8217;t likely to come
back to a girl that thinks I&#8217;m the lowest thing that
walks. You&#8217;re not through with me a bit more
than I am with you,&#8221; he answered harshly.</p>
<p>Her little hand beat upon the rock in her distress.
&#8220;I never would have believed it. Nobody could
have made me believe it. I&mdash;I&mdash;why, I trusted
you like my own father,&#8221; she lamented. &#8220;To think
that you would take that way to stock your ranch&mdash;and
with the cattle of my father, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>His face was hard as chiseled granite. &#8220;Distrust
all your friends. That&#8217;s the best way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t even denied it&mdash;not that it would
do any good,&#8221; she said miserably.</p>
<p>There was a sound of hard, grim laughter in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
throat. &#8220;No, and I ain&#8217;t going to deny it. Are
you ready to go yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>His repulse of her little tentative advance was
like a blow on the face to her.</p>
<p>She made a movement to rise. While she was
still on her knees he stooped, put his arms around
her, and took her into them. Before she could utter
her protest he had started down the trail toward
the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you? Let me go,&#8221; she ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not able to walk, and you&#8217;ll go the way
I say,&#8221; he told her shortly in a flinty voice.</p>
<p>Her anger was none the less because she realized
her helplessness to get what she wanted. Her teeth
set fast to keep back useless words. Into his stony
eyes her angry ones burned. The quick, irregular
rise and fall of her bosom against his heart told
him how she was struggling with her passion.</p>
<p>Once he spoke. &#8220;Tell me where it was you saw
this rustler&mdash;the exact place near as you can locate
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered only by a look.</p>
<p>The deputy strode into the living room of the
ranch with her in his arms. Lee was reading a
newspaper Jack had brought with him from Mesa.
At sight of them he started up hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goddlemighty, what&#8217;s the matter, Jack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a ricked ankle, Champ. Slipped on a
stone,&#8221; Flatray explained as he put Melissy down
on the lounge.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>In two minutes the whole house was upset. Hop
Ling was heating water to bathe the sprain. A
rider from the bunkhouse was saddling to go for
the doctor. Another was off in the opposite direction
to buy some liniment at Mammoth.</p>
<p>In the confusion Flatray ran up his horse from
the pasture, slapped on the saddle, and melted into
the night.</p>
<p>An hour later Melissy asked her father what had
become of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doggone that boy, I don&#8217;t know where he went.
Reckon he thought he&#8217;d be in the way. Mighty
funny he didn&#8217;t give us a chanct to tell him to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably he had business in Mesa,&#8221; Melissy answered,
turning her face to the wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Business nothing,&#8221; retorted the exasperated
rancher. &#8220;He figured we couldn&#8217;t eat and sleep
him without extra trouble. Ain&#8217;t that a fine reputation
for him to be giving the Bar Double G? I&#8217;ll
curl his hair for him onct I meet up with him
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you would put out the light, I think I could
sleep, dad,&#8221; she told him in the least of voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, honey. Has the throbbing gone out of
the ankle?&#8221; he asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not entirely, but it&#8217;s a good deal better. Good-night,
dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If Doc comes I&#8217;ll bring him in,&#8221; Lee said after
he had kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do, please.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></p>
<p>But after she was left alone Melissy did not prepare
herself for sleep. Her wide open eyes stared
into the darkness, while her mind stormily reviewed
the day. The man who for years had been her best
friend was a scoundrel. She had proved him unworthy
of her trust, and on top of that he had
insulted her. Hot tears stung her eyes&mdash;tears of
shame, of wounded self-love, of mortification, and
of something more worthy than any of these.</p>
<p>She grieved passionately for that which had gone
out of her life, for the comradeship that had been
so precious to her. If this man were a waddy, who
of all her friends could she trust? She could have
forgiven him had he done wrong in the heat of
anger. But this premeditated evil was beyond forgiveness.
To make it worse, he had come direct
from the doing of it to meet her, with a brazen
smile on his lips and a lie in his heart. She would
never speak to him again&mdash;never so long as she lived.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE MAN WITH THE CHIHUAHUA HAT</h3>
</div>

<p>A little dust cloud was traveling up the
trail toward the Bar Double G, the center
of which presently defined itself as a rider
moving at a road gait. He wore a Chihuahua hat
and with it the picturesque trappings the Southwest
borrows on occasion from across the border. Vanity
disclosed itself in the gold-laced hat, in the silver
conchos of the fringed chaps, in the fine workmanship
of the saddle and bit. The man&#8217;s finery was
overdone, carried with it the suggestion of being
on exhibition. But one look at the man himself,
sleek and graceful, black-haired and white-toothed,
exuding an effect of cold wariness in spite of the
masked smiling face, would have been enough to
give the lie to any charge of weakness. His fopperies
could not conceal the silken strength of him.
One meeting with the chill, deep-set eyes was certificate
enough for most people.</p>
<p>Melissy, sitting on the porch with her foot resting
on a second chair, knew a slight quickening of
the blood as she watched him approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evenin&#8217;, Miss M&#8217;lissy,&#8221; he cried, sweeping
his sombrero as low as the stirrup.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos tardes</i>, <i>Señor</i> Norris,&#8221; she flung back
gayly.</p>
<p>Sitting at ease in the saddle, he leisurely looked
her over with eyes that smoldered behind half-shuttered
lids. To most of her world she was in spirit
still more boy than woman, but before his bold, possessive
gaze her long lashes wavered to the cheeks
into which the warm blood was beating. Her long,
free lines were still slender with the immaturity
of youth, her soul still hesitating reluctantly to
cross the border to womanhood toward which Nature
was pushing her so relentlessly. From a fund
of experience Philip Norris read her shrewdly,
knew how to evoke the latent impulses which
brought her eagerly to the sex duel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing off for sick,&#8221; he scoffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not,&#8221; she protested. &#8220;Never get sick. It&#8217;s
just a sprained ankle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! I guess you&#8217;re Miss Make Believe; just
harrowing the feelings of your beaux.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The way you talk! I haven&#8217;t got any beaux.
The boys are just my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just friends! And no beaux. My, my!
Not a single sweetheart in all this wide open country.
Shall I go rope you one and bring him in,
<i>compadre</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she exploded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any. I&#8217;m
not old enough yet.&#8221; Her dancing eyes belied the
words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it. You look to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
me most ready to be picked.&#8221; He rested his weight
on the farther stirrup and let his lazy smile mock
her. &#8220;My estimate would be sixteen. I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re
every day of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only lack three months of being eighteen,&#8221; she
came back indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! You&#8217;ll ce&#8217;tainly have to be advertising
for a husband soon, Miss Three-Quarters-Past-Seventeen.
Maybe an ad in the Mesa paper
would help. You ain&#8217;t so awful bad looking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you write it. What would you say?&#8221;
she demanded, a patch of pink standing out near
the curve of the cheek bone.</p>
<p>He swung from the saddle and flung the reins
to the ground. With jingling spurs he came up
the steps and sat on the top one, his back against
a pillar. Boldly his admiring eyes swept her.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Nina</i>, I couldn&#8217;t do the subject justice. Honest,
I haven&#8217;t got the vocabulary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; Laughter was in the eyes that studied
him with a side tilt of the chin. &#8220;That&#8217;s a fine
way to get out of it when your bluff is called.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned back against the post comfortably and
absorbed the beauty of the western horizon. The
sun had just set behind a saddle of the Galiuros in
a splash of splendor. All the colors of the rainbow
fought for supremacy in a brilliant-tinted sky that
blazed above the fire-girt peaks. Soon dusk would
slip down over the land and tone the hues to a
softer harmony. A purple sea would flow over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
hills, to be in turn displaced by a deep, soft violet.
Then night, that night of mystery and romance
which transforms the desert to a thing of incredible
wonder!</p>
<p>&#8220;Did your father buy this sunset with the ranch?
And has he got a guarantee that it will perform
every night?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see anything like it?&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I have looked at them all my life and I never get
tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed softly, his indolent, sleepy look on
her. &#8220;Some things I would never get tired of looking
at either.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without speaking she nodded, still absorbing the
sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it wouldn&#8217;t be that kind of scenery,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;How tall are you, <i>muchacha</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her glance came around in surprise. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know. About five foot five, I think. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m working on that ad. How would this do?
&#8216;Miss Three-Quarters-Past-Seventeen wants to meet
up with gentleman between eighteen and forty-eight.
Object, matrimony. Description of lady:
Slim, medium height, brunette, mop of blue-black
hair, the prettiest dimple you ever saw&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know you&#8217;re making fun of me. I&#8217;m
mad.&#8221; And the dimple flashed into being.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&mdash;mostly says the opposite of what she means,
has a&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&mdash;has a spice of the devil in her, which&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I <i>am</i> mad,&#8221; she interrupted, laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;&mdash;which is excusable, since she has the reddest
lips for kissing in Arizona.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had gone too far. Her innocence was in
arms. Norris knew it by the swiftness with which
the smile vanished from her face, by the flash of
anger in the eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I prefer to talk about something else, Mr. Norris,&#8221;
she said with all the prim stiffness of a schoolgirl.</p>
<p>Her father relieved the tension by striding across
from the stable. With him came a bowlegged young
fellow in plain leathers. The youngster was Charley
Hymer, one of the riders for the Bar Double G.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here at the right time, Norris,&#8221; Lee said
grimly. &#8220;Charley has just come down from Antelope
Pass. He found one of my cows dead, with
a bullet hole through the forehead. The ashes of
a fire were there, and in the brush not far away a
running iron.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eyes of Norris narrowed to slits. He was
the cattle detective of the association and for a year
now the rustlers had outgeneraled him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have
you take me to the spot, Charley. Get a move on
you and we&#8217;ll get there soon as the moon is up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy gripped the arms of her chair tightly
with both hands. She was looking at Norris with
a new expression, a kind of breathless fear. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
knew him for a man who could not be swerved from
the thing he wanted. For all his easy cynicism, he
had the reputation of being a bloodhound on the
trail. Moreover, she knew that he was no friend
to Jack Flatray. Why had she left that running
iron as evidence to convict its owner? What folly
not to have removed it from the immediate scene of
the crime!</p>
<p>The cattle detective and her father had moved
a few steps away and were talking in low tones.
Melissy became aware of a footfall. The man who
called himself Morse came around the corner of
the house and stopped at the porch steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I speak to you a moment, Miss Lee?&#8221; he
said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice of Norris rose to an irritated snarl.
&#8220;Tell you I&#8217;ve got evidence, Lee. Mebbe it&#8217;s not
enough to convict, but it satisfies me a-plenty that
Jack Flatray&#8217;s the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy was frozen to a tense attention. Her
whole mind was on what passed between the detective
and her father. Otherwise she would have noticed
the swift change that transformed the tenderfoot.</p>
<p>The rancher answered with impatient annoyance.
&#8220;You&#8217;re &#8217;way off, Norris. I don&#8217;t care anything
about your evidence. The idea is plumb ridiculous.
Twenty odd years I&#8217;ve known him. He&#8217;s the best
they make, a pure through and through. Not a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
crooked hair in his head. I&#8217;ve eat out of the same
frying pan too often with that boy not to know
what he is. You go bury those suspicions of yours
immediate. There&#8217;s nothing to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris grumbled objections as they moved toward
the stable. Melissy drew a long breath and brought
herself back to the tenderfoot.</p>
<p>He stood like a coiled spring, head thrust far
forward from the shoulders. The look in his black
eyes was something new to her experience. For
hate, passion, caution were all mirrored there.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know Mr. Norris,&#8221; she said quickly.</p>
<p>He started. &#8220;What did you say his name was?&#8221;
he asked with an assumption of carelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Norris&mdash;Philip Norris. He is a cattle detective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never heard of Mr. Norris before in my life,&#8221;
he answered, but it was observable that he still
breathed deep.</p>
<p>She did not believe him. Some tie in their buried
past bound these two men together. They must
have known each other in the South years ago, and
one of them at least was an enemy of the other.
There might come a day when she could use this
knowledge to save Jack Flatray from the punishment
dogging his heels. Melissy filed it away in
her memory for future reference.</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted to speak to me,&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m not a hound. I can&#8217;t blackmail a
woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that you&#8217;ve found work here for me
because I saw what you did over by Antelope Pass.
We made a bargain. Oh, not in words, but a bargain
just the same! You were to keep my secret
because I knew yours. I release you from your part
of it. Give me up if you think it is your duty.
I&#8217;ll not tell what I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t how you talked the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s how I talk now. I&#8217;m a hunted man,
wanted for murder. I make you a present of the
information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You make me a present of what I already know,
Mr. Diller, alias Morse, alias Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You guessed it the first day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And meant to keep quiet about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I meant to shelter you from the punishment
you deserve.&#8221; She added with a touch of bitter
self-scorn: &#8220;I was doing what I had to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do it any longer.&#8221; He looked
straight at her with his head up. &#8220;And how do you
know what I deserve? Who made you a judge
about these facts? Grant for the sake of argument
I killed him. Do you know I wasn&#8217;t justified?&#8221;</p>
<p>His fierce boldness put her on the defense. &#8220;A
man sure of his cause does not run away. The
paper said this Shep Boone was shot from ambush.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
Nothing could justify such a thing. When you
did that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t believe it, Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was shot from behind, the paper said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look like a man who would kill from
ambush?&#8221;</p>
<p>She admitted to herself that this clear-eyed Southerner
did not look like an assassin. Life in the open
had made her a judge of such men as she had been
accustomed to meet, but for days she had been telling
herself she could no longer trust her judgment.
Her best friend was a rustler. By a woman&#8217;s logic
it followed that since Jack Flatray was a thief this
man might have committed all the crimes in the
calendar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Then, impulsively, &#8220;No, you
don&#8217;t, but you may be for all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking anything for myself. You may
do as you please after I&#8217;ve gone. Send for Mr.
Flatray and tell him if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A horse cantered across the plaza toward the
store. Bellamy turned quickly to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to tell anyone,&#8221; the girl called
after him in a low voice.</p>
<p>Norris swung from the saddle. &#8220;Who&#8217;s our hurried
friend?&#8221; he asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a new rider of ours. Name of Morse.&#8221;
She changed the subject. &#8220;Are you&mdash;do you think
you know who the rustler is?&#8221;</p>
<p>His cold, black eyes rested in hers. She read in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
them something cruel and sinister. It was as if he
were walking over the grave of an enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gathering evidence, a little at a time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;Wait till I&#8217;ve got him
cinched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told father,&#8221; she accused.</p>
<p>He laughed in a hard, mirthless fashion. &#8220;That
cured me. The Lee family is from Missouri. When
I talk next time I&#8217;ll have the goods to show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know who you mean. You&#8217;re making a mistake.&#8221;
Her voice seemed to plead with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life, I ain&#8217;t. But we&#8217;ll talk about
that when the subject is riper. There will be a
showdown some day, and don&#8217;t you forget it. Well,
Charley is calling me. So long, Miss Three-Quarters-Past-Seventeen.&#8221;
He went jingling down the
steps and swung to the saddle. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not forget the
ad, and when I find the right man I&#8217;ll ce&#8217;tainly rope
and bring him to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rustler?&#8221; she asked innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not the rustler, the gent between eighteen
and forty-eight, object matrimony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trouble you,&#8221; she flung at him
with her gay smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;No trouble at all. Fact is, I&#8217;ve got him in mind
already,&#8221; he assured her promptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; A pulse of excitement was beating in
her throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t ask me who he is,&#8221; suggested Norris
boldly, crouched in the saddle with his weight on
the far stirrup.</p>
<p>She had brought it upon herself, but now she
dodged the issue. &#8220;&#8217;Most anyone will do, and me
going on eighteen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, girl. Only one out of a thousand
will do for your master.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master, indeed! If he comes to the Bar
Double G he&#8217;ll find he is at the wrong address.
None wanted, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most folks don&#8217;t want what&#8217;s best for them, I
allow. But if they have luck it sometimes comes
to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Luck!&#8221; she echoed, her chin in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard me right. What you need is a man
that ain&#8217;t afraid of you, one to ride close herd on
you so as to head off them stampede notions of
yours. Now this lad is the very one. He is a
black-haired guy, and when he says a thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Involuntarily she glanced at his sleek black head.
Melissy felt a sudden clamor of the blood, a pounding
of the pulses.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;he most generally means it. I&#8217;ve wrangled
around a heap with him and there&#8217;s no manner of
doubt he&#8217;s up to specifications. In appearance he
looks like me. Point of fact, he&#8217;s a dead ringer
for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>She saw her chance and flashed out. &#8220;Now you&#8217;re
flattering him. There can&#8217;t be two as&mdash;as fascinating
as Señor Norris,&#8221; she mocked.</p>
<p>His smoldering eyes had the possessive insolence
she resented and yet found so stimulating.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I say there were two?&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>It was his parting shot. With a touch of the
spur he was off, leaving her no time for an adequate
answer.</p>
<p>There were no elusions and inferences about
Philip Norris when he wanted to be direct. He had
fairly taken her breath away. Melissy&#8217;s instinct
told her there was something humiliating about
such a wooing. But picturesque and unconventional
conduct excuse themselves in a picturesque personality.
And this man had that if nothing else.</p>
<p>She told herself she was angry at him, that he
took liberties far beyond those of any of the other
young men. Yet, somehow, she went into the house
smiling. A color born of excitement burned beneath
her sparkling eyes. She had entered into her
heritage of womanhood and the call of sex was
summoning her to the adventure that is old as the
garden where Eve met Adam.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE TENDERFOOT TAKES UP A CLAIM</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Diller, alias Morse, alias Bellamy,
did not long remain at the Bar Double G
as a rider. It developed that he had
money, and, tenderfoot though he was, the man
showed a shrewd judgment in his investments. He
bought sheep and put them on the government forest
reserve, much to the annoyance of the cattlemen
of the district.</p>
<p>Morse, as he now called himself, was not the
first man who had brought sheep into the border
country. Far up in the hills were several camps
of them. But hitherto these had been there on sufferance,
and it had been understood that they were
to be kept far from the cattle range. The extension
of the government reserves changed the equation.
A good slice of the range was cut off and
thrown open to sheep. When Morse leased this
and put five thousand bleaters upon the feeding
ground the sentiment against him grew very bitter.</p>
<p>Lee had been spokesman of a committee appointed
to remonstrate with him. Morse had met them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
pleasantly but firmly. This part of the reserve had
been set aside for sheep. If it were not leased by
him it would be by somebody else. Therefore, he
declined to withdraw his flocks. Champ lost his
temper and swore that he for one would never submit
to yield the range. Sharp bitter words were
passed. Next week masked men drove a small
flock belonging to Morse over a precipice.</p>
<p>The tenderfoot retaliated by jumping a mining
claim staked out by Lee upon which the assessment
work had not been kept up. The cattleman contested
this in the courts, lost the decision, and
promptly appealed. Meanwhile, he countered by
leasing from the forest supervisor part of the run
previously held by his opponent and putting sheep
of his own upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll play Mr. Morse&#8217;s own game and
see how he likes it,&#8221; the angry cattleman told his
friends.</p>
<p>But the luck was all with Morse. Before he had
been working his new claim a month the Monte
Cristo (he had changed the name from its original
one of Melissy) proved a bonanza. His men ran
into a rich streak of dirt that started a stampede
for the vicinity.</p>
<p>Champ indulged in choice profanity. From his
point of view he had been robbed, and he announced
the fact freely to such acquaintances as dropped into
the Bar Double G store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad gum it, I was aimin&#8217; to do that assessment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
work and couldn&#8217;t jest lay my hands on the time.
I&#8217;d been a millionaire three years and didn&#8217;t know
it. Then this damned Morse butts in and euchres
me out of the claim. Some day him and me&#8217;ll have
a settlement. If the law don&#8217;t right me, I reckon
I&#8217;m most man enough to &#8217;tend to Mr. Morse.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his daughter who had hitherto succeeded
in keeping the peace. When the news of the relocation
had reached Lee he had at once started to settle
the matter with a Winchester, but Melissy, getting
news of his intention, had caught up a horse and
ridden bareback after him in time to avert by her
entreaties a tragedy. For six months after this
the men had not chanced to meet.</p>
<p>Why the tenderfoot had first come West&mdash;to hide
what wounds in the great baked desert&mdash;no man
knew or asked. Melissy had guessed, but she did
not breathe to a soul her knowledge. It was a first
article of Arizona&#8217;s creed that a man&#8217;s past belonged
to him alone, was a blotted book if he chose
to have it so. No doubt many had private reasons
for their untrumpeted migration to that kindly
Southwest which buries identity, but no wise citizen
busied himself with questions about antecedents.
The present served to sift one, and by the way a
man met it his neighbors judged him.</p>
<p>And T. L. Morse met it competently. In every
emergency with which he had to cope the man
&#8220;stood the acid.&#8221; Arizona approved him a man,
without according him any popularity. He was too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
dogmatic to win liking, but he had a genius for success.
Everything he touched turned to gold.</p>
<p>The Bar Double G lies half way between Mammoth
and Mesa. Its position makes it a central
point for ranchers within a radius of fifteen miles.
Out of the logical need for it was born the store
which Beauchamp Lee ran to supply his neighbors
with canned goods, coffee, tobacco, and other indispensables;
also the eating house for stage passengers
passing to and from the towns. Young as
she was, Melissy was the competent manager of
both of these.</p>
<p>It was one afternoon during the hour the stage
stopped to let the passengers dine that Melissy&#8217;s
wandering eye fell upon Morse seated at one of the
tables. Anger mounted within her at the cool impudence
of the man. She had half a mind to order
him out, but saw he was nearly through dinner
and did not want to make a scene. Unfortunately
Beauchamp Lee happened to come into the store
just as his enemy strolled out from the dining-room.</p>
<p>The ranchman stiffened. &#8220;What you been doing
in there, seh?&#8221; he demanded sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been eating a very good dinner in a public
café. Any objections?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty of &#8217;em, seh. I don&#8217;t aim to keep open
house for Mr. Morse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand this is a business proposition. I
expect to pay seventy-five cents for my meal.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>The eyes of the older man gleamed wrathfully.
&#8220;As for yo&#8217; six bits, if you offer it to me I&#8217;ll take
it as an insult. At the Bar Double G we&#8217;re not
doing friendly business with claim jumpers. Don&#8217;t
you evah set yo&#8217; legs under my table again, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morse shrugged, turned away to the public desk,
and addressed an envelope, the while Lee glared at
him from under his heavy beetling brows. Melissy
saw that her father was still of half a mind to
throw out the intruder and she called him to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad, José wants you to look at the hoof of one
of his wheelers. He asked if you would come as
soon as you could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beauchamp still frowned at Morse, rasping his
unshaven chin with his hand. &#8220;Ce&#8217;tainly, honey.
Glad to look at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad! Please.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranchman went out, grumbling. Five minutes
later Morse took his seat on the stage beside
the driver, having first left seventy-five cents on
the counter.</p>
<p>The stage had scarce gone when the girl looked
up from her bookkeeping to see the man with the
Chihuahua hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos tardes, señorita</i>,&#8221; he gave her with a
flash of white teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos</i>,&#8221; she nodded coolly.</p>
<p>But the dancing eyes of her could not deny their
pleasure at sight of him. They had rested upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
men as handsome, but upon none who stirred her
blood so much.</p>
<p>He was in the leather chaps of a cowpuncher,
gray-shirted, and a polka dot kerchief circled the
brown throat. Life rippled gloriously from every
motion of him. Hermes himself might have envied
the perfect grace of the man.</p>
<p>She supplied his wants while they chatted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jogged off your range quite a bit, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some. I&#8217;ll take two bits&#8217; worth of that smokin&#8217;,
<i>nina</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I&#8217;m no little girl. Don&#8217;t
you know I&#8217;m now half past eighteen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my. That ad didn&#8217;t do a mite of good,
did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you growing older every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does my age show?&#8221; she wanted to know
anxiously.</p>
<p>The scarce veiled admiration of his smoldering
eyes drew the blood to her dusky cheeks. Something
vigilant lay crouched panther-like behind the
laughter of his surface badinage.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re standing it well, honey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color beat into her face, less at the word
than at the purring caress in his voice. A year ago
she had been a child. But in the Southland flowers
ripen fast. Adolescence steals hard upon the heels
of infancy, and, though the girl had never wakened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
to love, Nature was pushing her relentlessly toward
a womanhood for which her unschooled impulses
but scantily safeguarded her.</p>
<p>She turned toward the shelves. &#8220;How many air-tights
did you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say.&#8221; He leaned forward across the
counter. &#8220;What&#8217;s the hurry, little girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Melissy Lee,&#8221; she told him over
her shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine is Phil Norris. Glad to give it to you,
Melissy Lee,&#8221; the man retorted glibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t use it, thank you,&#8221; came her swift saucy
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or to lend it to you&mdash;say, for a week or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed a look at him and passed quickly
from behind the counter. Her father was just coming
into the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you wait on Mr. Norris, dad? Hop wants
to see me in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris swore softly under his breath. The last
thing he had wanted was to drive her away. It
had been nearly a year since he had seen her last,
but the picture of her had been in the coals of
many a night camp fire.</p>
<p>The cattle detective stayed to dinner and to supper.
He and her father had their heads together
for hours, their voices pitched to a murmur. Melissy
wondered what business could have brought
him, whether it could have anything to do with the
renewed rustling that had of late annoyed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
neighborhood. This brought her thoughts to Jack
Flatray. He, too, had almost dropped from her
world, though she heard of him now and again.
Not once had he been to see her since the night she
had sprained her ankle.</p>
<p>Later, when Melissy was watering the roses beside
the porch, she heard the name of Morse mentioned
by the stock detective. He seemed to be
urging upon her father some course of action at
which the latter demurred. The girl knew a vague
unrest. Lee did not need his anger against Morse
incensed. For months she had been trying to allay
rather than increase this. If Philip Norris had come
to stir up smoldering fires, she would give him a
piece of her mind.</p>
<p>The men were still together when Melissy told
her father good-night. If she had known that a
whisky bottle passed back and forth a good many
times in the course of the evening, the fears of the
girl would not have been lightened. She knew that
in the somber moods following a drinking bout the
lawlessness of Beauchamp Lee was most likely to
crop out.</p>
<p>As for the girl, now night had fallen&mdash;that wondrous
velvet night of Arizona, which blots out garish
day with a cloak of violet, purple-edged where
the hills rise vaguely in the distance, and softens
magically all harsh details beneath the starry vault&mdash;she
slipped out to the summit of the ridge in the
big pasture, climbing lightly, with the springy ease
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
born of the vigor her nineteen outdoor years had
stored in the strong young body. She wanted to
be alone, to puzzle out what the coming of this man
meant to her. Had he intended anything by that
last drawling remark of his in the store? Why was
it that his careless, half insulting familiarity set the
blood leaping through her like wine? He lured her
to the sex duel, then trampled down her reserves
roughshod. His bold assurance stung her to anger,
but there was a something deeper than anger that
left her flushed and tingling.</p>
<p>Both men slept late, but Norris was down first.
He found Melissy superintending a drive of sheep
which old Antonio, the herder, was about to make
to the trading-post at Three Pines. She was on
her pony near the entrance to the corral, her slender,
lithe figure sitting in a boy&#8217;s saddle with a businesslike
air he could not help but admire. The gate
bars had been lifted and the dog was winding its
way among the bleating gray mass, which began
to stir uncertainly at its presence. The sheep dribbled
from the corral by ones and twos until the
procession swelled to a swollen stream that poured
forth in a torrent. Behind them came Antonio in
his sombrero and blanket, who smiled at his mistress,
shouted an &#8220;<i>Adios, señorita</i>,&#8221; and disappeared
into the yellow dust cloud which the herd left in its
wake.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does Champ like being in the sheep business,&#8221;
Norris said to the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Melissy did not remove her eyes from the vanishing
herd, but a slight frown puckered her forehead.
She chose to take this as a criticism of her father
and to resent it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he be?&#8221; she said quietly,
answering the spirit of his remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean it that way,&#8221; he protested, with
his frank laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then if you didn&#8217;t mean it so, I shan&#8217;t take it
that way;&#8221; and her smile met his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s how I look at this sheep business. Some
ranges are better adapted for sheep than cattle, and
you can&#8217;t keep Mary&#8217;s little lamb away from those
places. No use for a man to buck against the thing
that&#8217;s bound to be. Better get into the band-wagon
and ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what father thought,&#8221; the girl confessed.
&#8220;He never would have been the man to bring sheep
in, but after they got into the country he saw it was
a question of whether he was going to get the government
reserve range for his sheep, or another
man, some new-comer like Mr. Morse, for his. It
was going to be sheep anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad your father took the chance he
saw.&#8221; He added reminiscently: &#8220;We got to be
right good friends again last night before we
parted.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took the opening directly. &#8220;If you&#8217;re so good
a friend of his, you must not excite him about Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Morse. You know he&#8217;s a Southerner, and he is
likely to do something rash&mdash;something we shall
all be sorry for afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that will be all right,&#8221; he said evasively.</p>
<p>Her eyes swept to his. &#8220;You won&#8217;t get father
into trouble will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The warm, affectionate smile came back to his
face, so that as he looked at her he seemed a sun-god.
But again there was something in his gaze
that was not the frankness of a comrade, some
smoldering fire that strangely stirred her blood and
yet left her uneasy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not liable to bring trouble to those you love,
girl. I stand by my friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her pony began to move toward the house, and
he strode beside, as debonair and gallant a figure as
ever filled the eye and the heart of a woman. The
morning sun glow irradiated him, found its sparkling
reflection in the dark curls of his bare head,
in the bloom of his tanned cheeks, made a fit setting
for the graceful picture of lingering youth his slim,
muscular figure and springy stride personified.
Small wonder the untaught girl beside him found
the merely physical charm of him fascinating. If
her instinct sometimes warned her to beware, her
generous heart was eager to pay small heed to the
monition except so far as concerned her father.</p>
<p>After breakfast he came into the office to see her
before he left.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by for a day or two,&#8221; he said, offering
his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming back again, are you?&#8221; she asked
quietly, but not without a deeper dye in her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m coming back. Will you be glad to see
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I be glad? I hardly know you
these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know me better before we&#8217;re through
with each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would acknowledge no interest in him, the
less because she knew it was there. &#8220;I may do that
without liking you better.&#8221;</p>
<p>And suddenly his swift, winning smile flashed
upon her. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve got to like me. I want
you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you get everything you want?&#8221; she smiled
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I want it enough, I usually do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then since you get so much, you&#8217;ll be better able
to do without my liking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to have it too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure.&#8221; She had a feeling that
things were moving too fast, and she hailed the
appearance of her father with relief. &#8220;Good morning,
dad. Did you sleep well? Mr. Norris is just
leaving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I git a bite o&#8217; breakfast and I&#8217;ll go with
you, Phil,&#8221; promised Lee. &#8220;I got to ride over to
Mesa anyhow some time this week.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>The girl watched them ride away, taking the road
gait so characteristic of the Southwest. As long
as they were in sight her gaze followed them, and
when she could see nothing but a wide cloud of
dust travelling across the mesa she went up to her
room and sat down to think it out. Something new
had come into her life. What, she did not yet know,
but she tried to face the fact with the elemental
frankness that still made her more like a boy than
a woman. Sitting there before the looking-glass,
she played absently with the thick braid of heavy,
blue-black hair which hung across her shoulder to
the waist. It came to her for the first time to
wonder if she was pretty, whether she was going to
be one of the women that men desire. Without the
least vanity she studied herself, appraised the soft
brown cheeks framed with ebon hair, the steady,
dark eyes so quick to passion and to gaiety, the
bronzed throat full and rounded, the supple, flowing
grace of the unrestrained body.</p>
<p>Gradually a wave of color crept into her cheeks
as she sat there with her chin on her little doubled
hand. It was the charm of this Apollo of the plains
that had set free such strange thoughts in her head.
Why should she think of him? What did it matter
whether she was good-looking? She shook herself
resolutely together and went down to the business
of the day.</p>
<p>It was not long after midnight the next day that
Champ Lee reached the ranch. His daughter came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
out from her room in her night-dress to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kept you, Daddy?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>But before he could answer she knew. She read
the signs too clearly to doubt that he had been
drinking.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;HANDS UP&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Melissy had been up the Cañ del Oro
for wild poppies in her runabout and had
just reached the ranch. She was disposing
of her flowers in ollas when Jim Budd, waiter,
chambermaid, and odd jobs man at the Bar Double
G, appeared in the hall with a frightened, mysterious
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Jim? You and Hop Ling
been quarrelling again?&#8221; she asked carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, that ain&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s wusser&#8217;n that. I got
to tell you-all su&#8217;thin&#8217; I hearn yore paw say.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up quickly at him. &#8220;What do
you mean, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That Mistah Norris he come back whilst you
wus away, and him and yore paw wus in that back
room a-talkin&#8217; mighty confidential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and you listened. Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim swelled with offended dignity. &#8220;No&#8217;m, I
didn&#8217;t listen neither. I des natcherally hearn, &#8217;count
of that hole fer the stovepipe what comes through
the floor of my room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what was it you heard?&#8221; she interrupted
impatiently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wus a-comin&#8217; to that. Plum proverdenshul, I
draps into my room des as yore paw wus sayin&#8217;,
&#8217;Twenty thousand dollars goin&#8217; down to the Fort
on the stage to-day?&#8217; &#8217;Cose I pricks up my ears
then and tuk it all in. This yere Norris had foun&#8217;
out that Mistah Morse was shippin&#8217; gold from his
mine to-day on the Fort Allison stage, and he gits
yore paw to go in with him an&#8217; hold it up. Yore
paw cussed and said as how &#8217;t wus his gold anyhow
by rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl went white and gave a little broken cry.
&#8220;Oh, Jim! Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas&#8217;m, &#8217;cose I&#8217;m suah. Them&#8217;s his ve&#8217;y words.
Hope to die if they ain&#8217;t. They wus drinkin&#8217;, and
when &#8217;t wus all fixed up that &#8217;t wus to be at the
mouth of the Box Cañon they done tore an old
black shirt you got for a dust-rag and made masks
out of it and then rode away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tow&#8217;ds the Box Cañon Miss M&#8217;lissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slender, pallid figure of despair, she leaned
against the wall to support the faintness that had
so suddenly stolen the strength from her limbs,
trying desperately to think of some way to save her
father from this madness. She was sure he would
bungle it and be caught eventually, and she was
equally sure he would never let himself be taken
alive. Her helplessness groped for some way out.
There must be some road of escape from this horrible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
situation, and as she sought blindly for it the
path opened before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Hop?&#8221; she asked quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-sleepin&#8217; in his room, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to the store and tend it till I come back, Jim.
I may be an hour, or mebbe two, but don&#8217;t you move
out of it for a moment. And don&#8217;t ever speak of
any of this, not a word, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, &#8217;cose I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>His loyalty she did not doubt an instant, though
she knew his simple wits might easily be led to
indiscretion. But she did not stay to say more
now, but flew upstairs to the room that had been
her brother&#8217;s before he left home. Scarce five minutes
elapsed before she reappeared transformed. It
was a slim youth garbed as a cowpuncher that now
slipped along the passage to the rear, softly opened
the door of the cook&#8217;s room, noiselessly abstracted
the key, closed the door again as gently, and locked
it from the outside. She ran into her own room,
strapped on her revolver belt, and took her empty
rifle from its case. As she ran through the room
below the one Jim occupied, she caught sight of a
black rag thrown carelessly into the fireplace and
stuffed it into her pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just like Dad to leave evidence lying
around,&#8221; she said to herself, for even in the anxiety
that was flooding her she kept her quiet commonsense.</p>
<p>After searching the horizon carefully to see that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
nobody was in sight, she got into the rig and drove
round the corral to the irrigating ditch. This was
a wide lateral of the main canal, used to supply the
whole lower valley with water, and just now it was
empty. Melissy drove down into its sandy bed and
followed its course as rapidly as she could. If she
were only in time! If the stage had not yet passed!
That was her only fear, the dread of being too late.
Not once did the risk of the thing she intended
occur to her. Physical fear had never been part of
her. She had done the things her brother Dick had
done. She was a reckless rider, a good shot, could
tramp the hills or follow the round-up all day without
knowing fatigue. If her flesh still held its girlish
curves and softness, the muscles underneath
were firm and compact. Often for her own amusement
and that of her father she had donned her
brother&#8217;s chaps, his spurs, sombrero, and other paraphernalia,
to masquerade about the house in them.
She had learned to imitate the long roll of the
vaquero&#8217;s stride, the mannerisms common to his
class, and even the heavy voice of a man. More
than once she had passed muster as a young man
in the shapeless garments she was now wearing.
She felt confident that the very audacity of the thing
would carry it off. There would be a guard for the
treasure box, of course, but if all worked well he
could be taken by surprise. Her rifle was not loaded,
but the chances were a hundred to one that she
would not need to use it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>For the first time in his life the roan got the
whip from his mistress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git up, Bob. We&#8217;ve got to hurry. It&#8217;s for
dad,&#8221; she cried, as they raced through the sand
and sent it flying from the wheels.</p>
<p>The Fort Allison stage passed within three miles
of the Lee ranch on its way to Mesa. Where the
road met in intersection with the ditch she had
chosen as the point for stopping it, and no veteran
at the business could have selected more wisely, for
a reason which will hereafter appear. Some fifty
yards below this point of intersection the ditch ran
through a grove of cottonwoods fringing the bank.
Here the banks sloped down more gradually, and
Melissy was able to drive up one side, turn her rig
so that the horse faced the other way, and draw
down into the ditch again in order that the runabout
could not be seen from the road. Swiftly and skilfully
she obliterated the track she had made in the
sandy bank.</p>
<p>She was just finishing this when the sound of
wheels came to her. Rifle in hand, she ran back
along the ditch, stooping to pass under the bridge,
and waited at the farther side in a fringe of bushes
for the coming of the stage.</p>
<p>Even now fear had no place in the excitement
which burned high in her. The girl&#8217;s wits were
fully alert, and just in time she remembered the
need of a mask. Her searching fingers found the
torn black shirt in a pocket and a knife in another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Hastily she ripped the linen in half, cut out eyeholes,
and tied the mask about her head. With perfectly
steady hands she picked up the rifle from the ground
and pushed the muzzle of it through the bushes.</p>
<p>Leisurely the stage rolled up-grade toward the
crossing. The Mexican driver was half asleep and
the &#8220;shotgun messenger&#8221; was indolently rolling a
cigarette, his sawed-off gun between his knees.
Alan McKinstra was the name of this last young
gentleman. Only yesterday he had gone to work
for Morse, and this was the first job that had been
given him. The stage never had been held up since
the &#8220;Monte Cristo&#8221; had struck its pay-streak, and
there was no reason to suppose it would be. Nevertheless,
Morse proposed to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the man that holds down this job don&#8217;t
earn his salt, José. It&#8217;s what they call a sinecure,&#8221;
Alan was saying at the very instant the summons
came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw up your hands!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharp and crisp it fell on Alan&#8217;s ears. He sat for
a moment stunned, the half-rolled cigarette still
between his fingers. The driver drew up his four
horses with a jerk and brought them to a huddled
halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; came again the stinging imperative.</p>
<p>Now, for the first time, it reached Alan&#8217;s consciousness
that the stage was actually being held
up. He saw the sun shining on the barrel of a rifle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
and through the bushes the masked face of a hidden
cowpuncher. His first swift instinct was to give
battle, and he reached for the shotgun between his
knees. Simultaneously the driver&#8217;s foot gave it a
push and sent the weapon clattering to the ground.
José at least knew better than to let him draw the
road agent&#8217;s fire while he sat within a foot of the
driver. His hands went into the air, and after his
Alan&#8217;s and those of the two passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw down that box.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan lowered his hands and did as directed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now reach for the stars again.&#8221;</p>
<p>McKinstra&#8217;s arms went skyward. Without his
weapon, he was helpless to do otherwise. The
young man had an odd sense of unreality about the
affair, a feeling that it was not in earnest. The
timbre of the fresh young voice that came from
the bushes struck a chord in his memory, though
for the life of him he could not place its owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive on, José. Burn the wind and keep a-rollin&#8217;
south.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican&#8217;s whip coiled over the head of the
leaders and the broncos sprang forward with a
jump. It was the summit of a long hill, on the
edge of which wound the road. Until the stage
reached the foot of it there would be no opportunity
to turn back. Round a bend of the road it swung
at a gallop, and the instant it disappeared Melissy
leaped from the bushes, lifted the heavy box, and
carried it to the edge of the ditch. She flew down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the sandy bottom to the place where the rig stood,
drove swiftly back again, and, though it took the
last ounce of strength in her, managed to tumble
the box into the trap.</p>
<p>Back to the road she went, and from the place
where the box had fallen made long strides back
to the bushes where she had been standing at the
moment of the hold-up. These tracks she purposely
made deep and large, returning in her first ones to
the same point, but from the marks where the falling
treasure box had struck into the road she carefully
obliterated with her hand the foot-marks leading
to the irrigation ditch, sifting the sand in carefully
so as to leave no impression. This took scarcely
a minute. She was soon back in her runabout,
driving homeward fast as whip and voice could
urge the horse.</p>
<p>She thought she could reason out what McKinstra
and the stage-driver would do. Mesa was twenty-five
miles distant, the &#8220;Monte Cristo&#8221; mine seventeen.
Nearer than these points there was no telephone
station except the one at the Lee ranch. Their
first thought would be to communicate with Morse,
with the officers at Mammoth, and with the sheriff
of Mesa County. To do this as soon as possible
they would turn aside and drive to the ranch after
they reached the bottom of the hill and could make
the turn. It was a long, steep hill, and Melissy
estimated that this would give her a start of nearly
twenty minutes. She would save about half a mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
by following the ditch instead of the road, but at
best she knew she was drawing it very fine.</p>
<p>She never afterward liked to think of that drive
home. It seemed to her that Bob crawled and that
the heavy sand was interminable. Feverishly she
plied the whip, and when at length she drew out
of the ditch she sent her horse furiously round the
big corral. Though she had planned everything
to the last detail, she knew that any one of a hundred
contingencies might spoil her plan. A cowpuncher
lounging about the place would have ruined everything,
or at best interfered greatly. But the windmill
clicked over sunlit silence, empty of life. No
stir or movement showed the presence of any human
being.</p>
<p>Melissy drove round to the side door, dumped out
the treasure-box, ran into the house, and quickly
returned with a hammer and some tacks, then fell
swiftly to ripping the oilcloth that covered the
box which stood against the wall to serve as a handy
wash-stand for use by dusty travellers before dining.
The two boxes were of the same size and shape,
and she draped the treasure chest with the cloth,
tacked it in place, restored to the top of it the tin
basin, and tossed the former wash-stand among a
pile of old boxes from the store, that were to be
used for kindling. After this she ran upstairs,
scudded softly along the corridor, and silently
unlocked the cook&#8217;s door, dropping the key on the
floor to make it appear as if something had shaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
it from the keyhole. Presently she was in her
brother&#8217;s room, doffing his clothes and dressing
herself in her own.</p>
<p>A glance out of the window sapped the color
from her cheek, for she saw the stage breasting the
hill scarce two hundred yards from the house. She
hurried downstairs, pinning her belt as she ran, and
flashed into the store, where Jim sat munching
peanuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage is coming, Jim. Remember, you&#8217;re
not to know anything about it at all. If they ask
for Dad, say he&#8217;s out cutting trail of a bunch of hill
cows. Tell them I started after the wild flowers
about fifteen minutes ago. Don&#8217;t talk much about it,
though. I&#8217;ll be back inside of an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that she was gone, back to her trap, which
she swung along a trail back of the house till it met
the road a quarter of a mile above. Her actions
must have surprised steady old Bob, for he certainly
never before had seen his mistress in such a desperate
hurry as she had been this day and still was.
Nearly a mile above, a less well defined track
deflected from the main road. Into this she turned,
following it until she came to the head-gates of the
lateral which ran through their place. The main
canal was full of water, and after some effort she
succeeded in opening the head-gates so as to let the
water go pouring through.</p>
<p>Returning to the runabout, the girl drove across
a kind of natural meadow to a hillside not far distant,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
gathered a double handful of wild flowers, and
turned homeward again. The stage was still there
when she came in sight of the group of buildings
at the ranch.</p>
<p>As she drew up and dismounted with her armful
of flowers, Alan McKinstra stepped from the store
to the porch and came forward to assist her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fort Allison stage has been robbed,&#8221; he
blurted out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense! Who would want to rob it?&#8221;
she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morse had a gold shipment aboard,&#8221; he explained
in a low voice, and added in bitter self-condemnation:
&#8220;He sent me along to guard it, and I never
even fired a shot to save it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;do you mean that somebody held up the
stage?&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But whoever it was can&#8217;t escape. I&#8217;ve
&#8217;phoned to Jack Flatray and to Morse. They&#8217;ll be
right out here. The sheriff of Mesa County has
already started with a posse. They&#8217;ll track him
down. That&#8217;s a cinch. He can&#8217;t get away with
the box without a rig. If he busts the box, he&#8217;s
got to carry it on a horse and a horse leaves tracks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who do you think it was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. One of the Roaring Fork bunch
of bad men, likely. But I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man was plainly very much excited
and disturbed. He walked nervously up and down,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
jerking his sentences out piecemeal as he thought
of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there only one man? And did you see
him?&#8221; Melissy asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>He scarcely noticed her excitement, or if he did,
it seemed to him only natural under the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect there were more, but we saw only one.
Didn&#8217;t see much of him. He was screened by the
bushes and wore a black mask. So long as the stage
was in sight he never moved from that place; just
stood there and kept us covered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how could he rob you if he didn&#8217;t come
out?&#8221; she asked in wide-eyed innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t rob <i>us</i> any. He must &#8217;a&#8217; heard of the
shipment of gold, and that&#8217;s what he was after.
After he&#8217;d got us to rights he made me throw the
box down in the road. That&#8217;s where it was when
he ordered us to move on and keep agoing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you went?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;José handled the lines, but &#8217;t would &#8217;a&#8217; been the
same if I&#8217;d held them. That gun of his was a right
powerful persuader.&#8221; He stopped to shake a fist
in impotent fury in the air. &#8220;I wish to God I could
meet up with him some day when he didn&#8217;t have
the drop on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you will some time,&#8221; she told him soothingly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re a bit to blame, Alan.
Nobody could think so. Ever so many times I&#8217;ve
heard Dad say that when a man gets the drop on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
you there&#8217;s nothing to do but throw up your hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you honest think so, Melissy? Or are you
just saying it to take the sting away? Looks like
I ought to &#8217;a&#8217; done something mor&#8217;n sit there like a
bump on a log while he walked off with the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cheerful self-satisfaction was under eclipse.
The boyish pride of him was wounded. He had
not &#8220;made good.&#8221; All over Cattleland the news
would be wafted on the wings of the wind that
Alan McKinstra, while acting as shotgun messenger
to a gold shipment, had let a road agent hold him
up for the treasure he was guarding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely they&#8217;ll catch him and get the gold
back,&#8221; she suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do me any good,&#8221; he returned
gloomily. &#8220;The only thing that can help me now
is for me to git the fellow myself, and I might just
as well look for a needle in a haystack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell. The robber may be right round
here now.&#8221; Her eyes, shining with excitement,
passed the crowd moving in and out of the store,
for already the news of the hold-up had brought
riders and ranchmen jogging in to learn the truth
of the wild tale that had reached them.</p>
<p>&#8220;More likely he&#8217;s twenty miles away. But whoever
he is, he knows this county. He made a slip
and called José by his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy&#8217;s gaze was turned to the dust whirl that
advanced up the road that ran round the corral.
&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove anything, Alan. Everybody
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
knows José. He&#8217;s lived all over Arizona&mdash;at Tucson
and Tombstone and Douglas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right too,&#8221; the lad admitted.</p>
<p>The riders in advance of the dust cloud resolved
themselves into the persons of her father and
Norris. Her incautious admission was already
troubling her.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re right. No hold-up with
any sense would stay around here and wait to be
caught. He&#8217;s probably gone up into the Galiuros
to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he&#8217;s cached the gold and is trying to
throw off suspicion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl had moved forward to the end of the
house with Alan to meet her father. At that
instant, by the ironic humor of chance, her glance
fell upon a certain improvised wash-stand covered
with oilcloth. She shook her head decisively. &#8220;No,
he won&#8217;t risk waiting to do that. He&#8217;ll make sure
of his escape first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard, Daddy?&#8221; Melissy called out
eagerly. She knew she must play the part expected
of her, that of a young girl much interested in this
adventure which had occurred in the community.</p>
<p>He nodded grimly, swinging from the saddle.
She observed with surprise that his eye did not meet
hers. This was not like him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>His gaze met that of Norris before he answered,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
and there was in it some hint of a great fear.
&#8220;Beats me, &#8217;Lissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had told the simple truth, but not the whole
truth. The men had waited at the entrance to the
Box Cañon for nearly two hours without the arrival
of the stage. Deciding that something must have
happened, they started back, and presently met a
Mexican who stopped to tell them the news. To
say that they were dazed is to put it mildly. To
expect them to believe that somebody else had heard
of the secret shipment and had held up the stage
two miles from the place they had chosen, was to
ask a credulity too simple. Yet this was the fact
that confronted them.</p>
<p>Arrived at the scene of the robbery both men
had dismounted and had examined the ground
thoroughly. What they saw tended still more to
bewilder them. Neither of them was a tenderfoot,
and the little table at the summit of the long hill
told a very tangled tale to those who had eyes to
read. Obvious tracks took them at once to the
spot where the bandit had stood in the bushes, but
there was something about them that struck both
men as suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like these are worked out on purpose,&#8221;
commented Lee. &#8220;The guy&#8217;s leaving too easy a
trail to follow, and it quits right abrupt in the
bushes. Must &#8217;a&#8217; took an airship from here, I &#8217;low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does look funny. Hello! What&#8217;s this?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>Norris had picked up a piece of black cloth and
was holding it out. A startled oath slipped from
the lips of the Southerner. He caught the rag from
the hands of his companion and studied it with a
face of growing astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee dived into his pocket and drew forth the
mask he had been wearing. Silently he fitted it to
the other. The pieces matched exactly, both in
length and in the figure of the pattern.</p>
<p>When the Southerner looked up his hands were
shaking and his face ashen.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, Phil, what does this mean?&#8221;
he cried hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Search me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been&mdash;looks like the hold-up was
somebody&mdash;my God, man, we left this rag at the
ranch when we started!&#8221; the rancher whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We planned this thing right under the nigger&#8217;s
room. He must &#8217;a&#8217; heard and&mdash;&mdash; But it don&#8217;t
look like Jim Budd to do a thing like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris had crossed the road again and was standing
on the edge of the lateral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! This ditch is full of water. When we
passed down it was empty,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Lee crossed over and stood by his side, a puzzled
frown on his face. &#8220;There hadn&#8217;t ought to be water
running hyer now,&#8221; he said, as if to himself. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how it could &#8217;a&#8217; come hyer, for Bill Weston&mdash;he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the ditch rider&mdash;went to Mesa this mo&#8217;ning,
and couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; got back to turn it in.&#8221;</p>
<p>The younger man stooped and examined a foot-print
at the edge of the ditch. It was the one
Melissy had made just as she stepped into the rig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s something new, Lee. We haven&#8217;t seen
this gentleman&#8217;s track before. Looks like a boy&#8217;s.
It&#8217;s right firm and deep in this soft ground. I&#8217;ll
bet a cooky your nigger never made that track.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Southerner crouched down beside him, and
they looked at it together, head to head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it ain&#8217;t Jim&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t rightly <i>savez</i> this
thing at all,&#8221; the old man muttered, troubled at this
mystery which seemed to point to his household.</p>
<p>&#8220;By Moses, I&#8217;ve got it! The guy who did the
holding up had his horse down here. He loaded the
sack on its back and drove off up the ditch. All
we got to do is follow the ditch up or down till we
come to the place where he climbed out and struck
across country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Phil. He must have had a pardner
up at the head-gates. They had some kind of signal
arranged, and when Mr. Hold-up was ready down
come the water and washed out his tracks. It&#8217;s a
blame&#8217; smooth piece of business if you ask me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow made two bad breaks, though. That
piece of shirt is one. This foot-print is another.
They may land him in the pen yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it,&#8221; returned the old man with
composure, and as he spoke his foot erased the telltale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
print. &#8220;I &#8217;low there won&#8217;t anybody go to the
pen for he&#8217;pin himself to Mr. Morse&#8217;s gold dust.
I don&#8217;t give a cuss who it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris laughed in his low, easy way. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
you, Mr. Lee. We&#8217;ll make a thorough job while
we&#8217;re at it and mess up these other tracks. After
that we&#8217;ll follow the ditch up and see if there&#8217;s
anything doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>They remounted their broncos and rode them
across the tracks several times, then followed the
lateral up, one on either side of the ditch, their
eyes fastened to the ground to see any evidence of
a horse having clambered over the bank. They
drew in sight of the ranch house without discovering
what they were looking for. Lee&#8217;s heart was
in his mouth, for he knew that he would see presently
what his eye sought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon the fellow went down instead of up,&#8221;
suggested Norris.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he came up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee had stopped and was studying wheel tracks
that ran up from the ditch to his ranch house. His
face was very white and set. He pointed to them
with a shaking finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s where he went in the ditch, and there&#8217;s
where he came out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris forded the stream, cast a casual eye on
the double track, and nodded. He was still in a
fog of mystery, but the old man was already fearing
the worst.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>He gulped out his fears tremblingly. For himself,
he was of a flawless nerve, but this touched nearer
home than his own danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them wheel-tracks was made by my little
gyurl&#8217;s runabout, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens!&#8221; The younger man drew rein
sharply and stared at him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke off, recalling the sharp, firm little foot-print
on the edge of the ditch some miles below.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon I know what to think. If she
was in this, she&#8217;s got some good reason.&#8221; A wave
of passion suddenly swept the father. &#8220;By God!
I&#8217;d like to see the man that dares mix her name
up in this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris met this with his friendly smile. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t pick a row with me about that, old man. I&#8217;m
with you till the cows come home. But that ain&#8217;t
quite the way to go at this business. First thing,
we&#8217;ve got to wipe out these tracks. How? Why,
sheep! There&#8217;s a bunch of three hundred in that
pasture. We&#8217;ll drive the bunch down to the ditch
and water them here. <i>Savez?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And wipe out the wheel-marks in the sand.
Bully for you, Phil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea. After twelve hundred chisel
feet have been over this sand I reckon the wheel-tracks
will be missing.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode up to the house, and the first thing
that met them was the candid question of the girl:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard, Daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>And out of his troubled heart he had answered,
&#8220;Beats me, &#8217;Lissie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve sent for the officers. Jack Flatray is
on the way himself. So is Sheriff Burke,&#8221; volunteered
Alan gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting right busy, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; Norris sneered.</p>
<p>Again Lee glanced quickly at Norris. &#8220;I reckon,
Phil, we better drive that bunch of sheep down to
water right away. I clean forgot them this
mo&#8217;ning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; The younger man was not so easily
shaken. He turned to McKinstra naturally. &#8220;How
many of the hold-ups were there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw only one, and didn&#8217;t see him very good.
He was a slim fellow in a black mask.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say. Were you the driver?&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan felt the color suffuse his face. &#8220;No, I was
the guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you were the guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan felt the suave irony that covered this man&#8217;s
amusement, and he resented it impotently. When
Melissy came to his support he was the more
grateful.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we all think he did just right in using his
common sense, Mr. Norris,&#8221; the girl flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that he was gone after her father to
help him water the sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why those sheep have to be watered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
right now,&#8221; she frowned to Alan. &#8220;Dad <i>did</i> water
them this morning. I helped him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together they went into the store, where José
was telling his story for the sixth time to a listening
circle of plainsmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;And right then he come at you and ree-quested
yore whole outfit to poke a hole in the scenery with
yore front feet?&#8221; old Dave Ellis asked just as
Melissy entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, Señor.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of MacQueen&#8217;s Roaring Fork gang did it,
I&#8217;ll bet,&#8221; Alan contributed sourly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a lookin&#8217; guy was he?&#8221; spoke up
a dark young man known as Bob Farnum.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big man, <i>señor</i>, and looked a ruffian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re always that way until you run &#8217;em
down,&#8221; grinned Ellis. &#8220;Never knew a hold-up
wasn&#8217;t eight foot high and then some&mdash;to the fellow
at the wrong end of the gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean to say, Dave Ellis, that I lay down
to a bluff&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Alan was beginning hotly when the
old frontiersman interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your shirt on, McKinstra. I don&#8217;t mean
to say it. Nobody but a darn fool makes a gun-play
when the cards are stacked that-a-way. Yore
bad play was in reaching for the gun at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Jack Flatray will git him. I&#8217;ll bet a stack
of blues on that,&#8221; contributed a fat ranchman
wheezily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you mussed up the trail coming back,&#8221;
said Ellis to the stage-driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t. I thought of that, and I had José
drive clear round the place. Jack will find it all
right unless there&#8217;s too much travel before he gets
here,&#8221; said Alan.</p>
<p>Farnum laughed malevolently. &#8220;Mebbe he&#8217;ll get
him and mebbe he won&#8217;t. Jack&#8217;s human, like the
rest of us, if he is the best sheriff in Arizona. Here&#8217;s
hoping he don&#8217;t get him. Any man that waltzes out
of the cactus and appropriates twenty thousand
dollars belonging to Mr. Morse is welcome to it for
all of me. I don&#8217;t care if he is one of MacQueen&#8217;s
bad men. I wish it had been forty thousand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farnum did not need to explain the reasons for
his sentiments. Everybody present knew that he
was the leader of that bunch of cattlemen who had
bunched themselves together to resist the encroachments
of sheep upon the range. Among these the
feeling against Morse was explosively dangerous.
It had found expression in more than one raid upon
his sheep. Many of them had been destroyed by
one means or another, but Morse, with the obstinacy
characteristic of him, had replaced them with others
and continually increased his herds. There had
been threats against his life, and one of his herders
had been wounded. But the mine-owner went his
way with quiet fearlessness and paid no attention to
the animosity he had stirred up. The general feeling
was that the trouble must soon come to a head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Nobody expected the rough and ready vaqueros,
reckless and impulsive as they were, to submit to the
loss of the range, which meant too the wiping out
of their means of livelihood, without a bitter struggle
that would be both lawless and bloody.</p>
<p>Wherefore there was silence after Farnum had
spoken, broken at length by the amiable voice of
the fat ranchman, Baker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll see what we&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he wheezed
complacently. &#8220;And anyways I got to have some
horseshoe plug, Melissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl laughed nervously as she reached for
what he wanted. &#8220;You&#8217;re a safe prophet, Mr.
Baker,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d be a safe one if he&#8217;d prophesy that Jack
Flatray would have Mr. Hold-up in the calaboose
inside of three days,&#8221; put in a half-grown lad in
leathers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t so sure about that. You&#8217;ll have to show
me, and so will Mr. Deputy Sheriff Flatray,&#8221;
retorted Farnum.</p>
<p>A shadow darkened the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good afternoon, gentlemen all&mdash;and Miss Lee,&#8221;
a pleasant voice drawled.</p>
<p>The circle of eyes focused on the new-comer
and saw a lean, muscular, young fellow of medium
height, cool and alert, with the dust of the desert
on every sunbaked inch of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if it ain&#8217;t Jack here already!&#8221; gasped
Baker.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>WATERING SHEEP</h3>
</div>

<p>The deputy glanced quietly round, nodded
here and there at sight of the familiar
face of an acquaintance, and spoke to the
driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hear you say your little piece again, José.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican now had it by heart, and he pattered
off the thing from beginning to end without a pause.
Melissy, behind the counter, leaned her elbows on
it and fastened her eyes on the boyish face of the
officer. In her heart she was troubled. How much
did he know? What could he discover from the
evidence she had left? He had the reputation of
being the best trailer and the most fearless officer
in Arizona. But surely she had covered her tracks
safely.</p>
<p>From José the ranger turned to Alan. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
hear your account of it now, seh,&#8221; he said gently.</p>
<p>While Alan talked, Jack&#8217;s gaze drifted through
the window to the flock of sheep that were being
driven up from the ditch by Lee and Norris. That
little pastoral scene had its significance for him. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
had arrived at the locality of the hold-up a few minutes
after they had left, and his keen intelligence had
taken in some of the points they had observed. A
rapid circuit of the spot at the distance of thirty
yards had shown him no tracks leading from the
place except those which ran up the lateral on either
side of it. It was possible that these belonged to
the horses of the robbers, but if so the fellows
were singularly careless of detection. Moreover,
the booty must be accounted for. They had not
carried it with them, since no empty box remained
to show that they had poured the gold into sacks,
and it would have been impossible to take the box
as it was on a horse. Nor had they buried it,
unless at the bottom of the irrigating ditch, for
some signs of their work must have remained.</p>
<p>Balancing probabilities, it had seemed to Flatray
that these might be the tracks of ranchmen who had
arrived after the hold-up and were following the
escaping bandits up the lateral. For unless these
were the robber&#8217;s, there was no way of escape except
either up or down the bottom of the ditch. His
search had eliminated the possibility of any other
but the road, and this was travelled too frequently
to admit of even a chance of escape by it without
detection. Jack filed away one or two questions in
his brain for future reference. The most important
of these was to discover whether there had been any
water in the ditch at the time of the hold-up.</p>
<p>He had decided to follow the tracks leading up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
the ditch and found no difficulty in doing so at a
fast walk. Without any hesitation they paralleled
the edge of the lateral. Nor had the deputy travelled
a quarter of a mile before he made a discovery.
The rider on the right hand side of the stream
had been chewing tobacco, and he had a habit of
splashing his mark on boulders he passed in the
form of tobacco juice. Half a dozen times before
he reached the Lee ranch the ranger saw this signature
of identity writ large on smooth rocks shining
in the sun. The last place he saw it was at the
point where the two riders deflected from the lateral
toward the ranch house, following tracks which led
up from the bottom of the ditch.</p>
<p>An instant later Flatray had dodged back into the
chaparral, for somebody was driving a flock of
sheep down to the ditch. He made out that there
were two riders behind them, and that they had
no dog. For the present his curiosity was satisfied.
He thought he knew why they were watering sheep
in this odd fashion. Swiftly he had made a circuit,
drawn rein in front of the store, and dropped in
just in time to hear his name. Now, as with one
ear he listened to Alan&#8217;s account of the hold-up, with
his subconscious mind he was with the sheep-herders
who were driving the flock back into the pasture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like our friend the bad man was onto his
job all right,&#8221; was the deputy&#8217;s only comment when
Alan had finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s making his getaway into the hills
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
mighty immediate,&#8221; chuckled Baker. &#8220;He can&#8217;t
find a bank in the mountainside to deposit that gold
any too soon to suit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! I&#8217;ll bet he ain&#8217;t worried a mite. He&#8217;s got
his arrangements all made, and likely they&#8217;ll dovetail
to suit him. He&#8217;s put his brand on that gold
to stay,&#8221; answered Farnum confidently.</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s mild blue eyes rested on him amiably.
&#8220;Think so, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t knockin&#8217; you any, Jack. You&#8217;re all right.
But that&#8217;s how I figure it out, and, by Gad! I&#8217;m
hopin&#8217; it too,&#8221; Farnum made answer recklessly.</p>
<p>Flatray laughed and strolled from the crowded
room to the big piazza. A man had just cantered
up and flung himself from his saddle. The ranger,
looking at him, thought he had never seen another
so strikingly handsome an Apollo. Black eyes
looked into his from a sun-tanned face perfectly
modelled. The pose of the head and figure would
have delighted a sculptor.</p>
<p>There was a vigor, an unspoken hostility, in the
gaze of both men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mo&#8217;nin&#8221;, Mr. Deputy Sheriff, one said; and
the other, &#8220;Same to you, Mr. Norris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on the job quick,&#8221; sneered the cattle
detective.</p>
<p>&#8220;The quicker the sooner, I expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And by night you&#8217;ll have Mr. Hold-up roped
and hog-tied?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not so you could notice it. Are you a sheep-herder
these days, Mr. Norris?&#8221;</p>
<p>The gentle irony of this was not lost on its object,
for in the West a herder of sheep is the next remove
from a dumb animal.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m riding for the Quarter Circle K Bar
outfit. This is the first time I ever took the dust
of a sheep in my life. I did it to oblige Mr. Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! To oblige Mr. Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wanted to water them, and his herder wasn&#8217;t
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must &#8217;a&#8217; been wanting water mighty bad, I
reckon,&#8221; commented Jack amiably.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet! Lee feels better satisfied now he&#8217;s
watered them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris changed the subject. &#8220;You must have
burnt the wind getting here. I didn&#8217;t expect to see
you for some hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I happened to be down at Yeager&#8217;s ranch, and
one of the boys got me on the line from Mesa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Picked up any clues yet?&#8221; asked the other carelessly,
yet always with that hint of a sneer; and
innocently Flatray answered, &#8220;They seem to be right
seldom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know but you&#8217;d happened on the fellow&#8217;s
trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m as much at sea as you are,&#8221; was the
equivocal answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>Lee came over from the stable, still wearing spurs
and gauntlets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Howdy, Jack!&#8221; he nodded, not quite so much
at his ease as usual. &#8220;Got hyer on the jump,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kept movin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This shorely beats hell, don&#8217;t it?&#8221; Lee glanced
around, selected a smooth boulder, and fired his
discharge of tobacco juice at it true to the inch.
&#8220;Reminds me of the old days. You boys ain&#8217;t old
enough to recall them, but stage hold-ups were right
numerous then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blandly the deputy looked from one to the other.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose either of you gentlemen happen
to have been down and looked over the ground
where the hold-up was? The tracks were right
cut up before I got there.&#8221;</p>
<p>This center shot silenced Lee for an instant, but
Norris was on the spot with smiling ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Lee and I have been hunting strays
on the mesa. We didn&#8217;t hear about it till a few
minutes ago. We&#8217;re at your service, though, Mr.
Sheriff, to join any posses you want to send out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged. I&#8217;m going to send one out
toward the Galiuros in a few minutes now. I&#8217;ll
be right glad to have you take charge of it, Mr.
Norris.&#8221;</p>
<p>The derisive humor in the newly appointed
deputy&#8217;s eyes did not quite reach the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Whenever you want me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send Alan McKinstra along to
guide you. He knows that country like a book.
You want to head for the lower pass, swing up
Diable Cañon, and work up in the headquarters of
the Three Forks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within a quarter of an hour the posse was in
motion. Flatray watched it disappear in the dust
of the road without a smile. He had sent them out
merely to distract the attention of the public and
to get rid of as many as possible of the crowd. For
he was quite as well aware as the leader of the posse
that this search in the Galiuros was a wild-goose
chase. Somewhere within three hundred yards of
the place he stood both the robber and his booty
were in all probability to be found.</p>
<p>Flatray was quite right in his surmise, since
Melissy Lee, who had come out to see the posse off,
was standing at the end of the porch with her dusky
eyes fastened on him, the while he stood beside the
house with one foot resting negligently on the oilcloth
cover of the wash-stand.</p>
<p>She had cast him out of her friendship because
of his unworthiness, but there was a tumult in her
heart at sight of him. No matter how her judgment
condemned him as a villain, some instinct in
her denied the possibility of it. She was torn in
conflict between her liking for him and her conviction
that he deserved only contempt. Somehow
it hurt her too that he accepted without protest her
verdict, appeared so willing to be a stranger to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>Now that the actual physical danger of her adventure
was past, Melissy was aware too of a chill dread
lurking at her heart. She was no longer buoyed
up by the swiftness of action which had called for
her utmost nerve. There was nothing she could
do now but wait, and waiting was of all things the
one most foreign to her impulsive temperament.
She acknowledged too some fear of this quiet, soft-spoken
frontiersman. All Arizona knew not only
the daredevil spirit that fired his gentleness, but
the competence with which he set about any task
he assigned himself. She did not see how he <i>could</i>
unravel this mystery. She had left no clues behind
her, she felt sure of that, and yet was troubled lest
he guessed at her secret behind that mask of innocence
he wore. He did not even remotely guess it
as yet, but he was far closer to the truth than he
pretended. The girl knew she should leave him
and go about her work. Her rôle was to appear
as inconspicuous as possible, but she could not resist
the fascination of trying to probe his thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose your posse will come back with the
hold-ups in a few hours. Will it be worth while
to wait for them?&#8221; she asked with amiable derision.</p>
<p>The ranger had been absorbed in thought, his
chin in his hand, but he brought his gaze back
from the distance to meet hers. What emotion lay
behind those cold eyes she could not guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re more hopeful than I am, Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you sending them out for, then?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, the boys need to work off some of
their energy, and there&#8217;s always a show they might
happen onto the robbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think some of the Roaring Fork gang
did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are staying here in the hope that
they will drop in and deliver themselves to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her out of an expressionless face.
&#8220;That&#8217;s about it, I reckon. But what I tell the public
is that I&#8217;m staying so as to be within telephone connection.
You see, Sheriff Burke is moving up to
cut them off from the Catalinas, Jackson is riding
out from Mammoth to haid them off that way,
these anxious lads that have just pulled out from
here are taking care of the Galiuros. I&#8217;m supposed
to be sitting with my fingers on the keys as a sort
of posse dispatcher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you won&#8217;t catch them,&#8221; she told
him bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to be a prevailing sentiment round
here. You say it right hearty too; couldn&#8217;t be more
certain of your feelings if it had been your own
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it carelessly, yet with his keen blue eyes
fixed on her. Nevertheless, he was totally unprepared
for the effect of his words. The color washed
from her bronzed cheeks, and she stood staring at
him with big, fear-filled eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what do you mean?&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;How
dare you say that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t said anything so terrible. You don&#8217;t need
to take it to heart like that.&#8221; He gave her a faint
smile for an instant. &#8220;I&#8217;m not really expecting to
arrest Mr. Lee for holding up that stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color beat back slowly into her face. She
knew she had made a false move in taking so
seriously his remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you ought to joke about a thing
like that,&#8221; she said stiffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I&#8217;ll not say it next time till I&#8217;m in
earnest,&#8221; he promised as he walked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he really meant anything,&#8221; the girl
was thinking in terror, and he, &#8220;she knows something;
now, I would like to know what.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy attended to her duties in the postoffice
after the arrival of the stage, and looked after the
dining-room as usual, but she was all the time
uneasily aware that Jack Flatray had quietly disappeared.
Where had he gone? And why? She
found no answer to that question, but the ranger
dropped in on his bronco in time for supper, imperturbable
and self-contained as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;ll stay all night if you have a room for
me,&#8221; he told her after he had eaten.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a room,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What more have
you heard about the stage robbery?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I thought maybe you had,&#8221; she murmured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
tremulously, for his blue eyes were unwaveringly
upon her and she could not know how much or
how little he might mean.</p>
<p>Later she saw him sitting on the fence, holding
genial converse with Jim Budd. The waiter
was flashing a double row of white teeth in deep
laughter at something the deputy had told him.
Evidently they were already friends. When she
looked again, a few minutes later, she knew Jack
had reached the point where he was pumping Jim
and the latter was disseminating misinformation.
That the negro was stanch enough, she knew, but
she was on the anxious seat lest his sharp-witted
inquisitor get what he wanted in spite of him.
After he had finished with Budd the ranger drifted
around to the kitchen in time to intercept Hop Ling
casually as he came out after finishing his evening&#8217;s
work. The girl was satisfied Flatray could not
have any suspicion of the truth. Nevertheless, she
wished he would let the help alone. He might accidentally
stumble on something that would set him
on the right track.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE BOONE-BELLAMY FEUD IS RENEWED</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s six bits on the counter under a seed
catalogue. Did you leave it here, daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Champ Lee, seated on the porch just
outside the store door, took the pipe from his mouth
and answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why no, honey, I don&#8217;t reckon I did, not to my
ricollection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer. I know I didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy broke her sentence sharply. There had
come into her eyes a spark of excitement, simultaneous
with the brain-flash which told her who
had left the money. No doubt the quarter and the
half dollar had been lying there ever since the day
last week when Morse had eaten at the Bar Double
G. She addressed an envelope, dropped the money
in, sealed the flap, and put the package beside a
letter addressed to T. L. Morse.</p>
<p>Lee, full of an unhappy restlessness which he
could not control, presently got up and moved away
to the stables. He was blaming himself bitterly
for the events of the past few days.</p>
<p>It was perhaps half an hour later that Melissy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
looked up to see the sturdy figure of Morse in the
doorway. During the past year he had filled out,
grown stronger and more rugged. His deep tan
and heavy stride pronounced him an outdoor man
no less surely than the corduroy suit and the high
laced miners&#8217; boots.</p>
<p>He came forward to the postoffice window without
any sign of recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Flatray still here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Without further explanation Melissy
took from the box the two letters addressed to
Morse and handed them to him.</p>
<p>The girl observed the puzzled look that stole over
his face at sight of the silver in one envelope. A
glance at the business address printed on the upper
left hand corner enlightened him. He laid the
money down in the stamp window.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You heard what my father said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That applies to next time, not to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it does apply to this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see how you&#8217;re going to make me take
it back. I&#8217;m an obstinate man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden flush of anger swept her. She caught
up the silver and flung it through the open window
into the dusty road.</p>
<p>His dark eyes met hers steadily and a dull color
burned in his tanned cheeks. Without a word he
turned away, and instantly she regretted what she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
had done. She had insulted him deliberately and
put herself in the wrong. At bottom she was a
tender-hearted child, even though her father and his
friends had always spoiled her, and she could not
but reproach herself for the hurt look she had
brought into his strong, sad face. He was their
enemy, of course, but even enemies have rights.</p>
<p>Morse walked out of the office looking straight
before him, his strong back teeth gripped so that
the muscles stood out on his salient jaw. Impulsively
the girl ran around the counter after him.</p>
<p>He looked up from untying his horse to see her
straight and supple figure running toward him. Her
eager face was full of contrition and the color of
pink rose petals came and went in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Morse. I oughtn&#8217;t to have done
that. I hurt your feelings,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>At best he was never a handsome man, but now
his deep, dark eyes lit with a glow that surprised
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. Thank you very much,&#8221; he said
in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so tempery,&#8221; she explained in apology, and
added: &#8220;I suppose a nice girl wouldn&#8217;t have
done it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice girl did do it,&#8221; was all he could think
to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t take the trouble to say that. I know
I&#8217;ve just scrambled up and am not ladylike and
proper. Sometimes I don&#8217;t care. I like to be able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
to do things like boys. But I suppose it&#8217;s dreadful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it is at all. None of your friends
could think so. Not that I include myself among
them,&#8221; he hastened to disclaim. &#8220;I can&#8217;t be both
your friend and your enemy, can I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The trace of a sardonic smile was in his eyes.
For the moment as she looked at him she thought
he might. But she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see how.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hate me, I suppose,&#8221; he blurted out bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221; And more briskly she added,
with dimples playing near the corners of her mouth:
&#8220;Of course I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s frank. It&#8217;s worth something to have so
decent an enemy. I don&#8217;t believe you would shoot
me in the back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the others would. You should be more
careful,&#8221; she cried before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>He shrugged. &#8220;I take my fighting chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much of a one. You&#8217;ll be shot at from
ambush some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a new experience. I went through
it last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; she breathed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down by Willow Wash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, without amusement. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have
my rifle with me, so I didn&#8217;t stay to inquire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been some of those wild vaqueros.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was my guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have other enemies, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lee,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean others that are dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father would never do that except in a fair
fight. I wasn&#8217;t thinking of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whom you mean, but a few extras
don&#8217;t make much difference when one is so liberally
supplied already,&#8221; he said cynically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t make light of them if I were you,&#8221;
she cautioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said all I&#8217;m going to, and more than I
ought,&#8221; she told him decisively. &#8220;Except this, that
it&#8217;s your own fault. You shouldn&#8217;t be so stiff. Why
don&#8217;t you compromise? With the cattlemen, for instance.
They have a good deal of right on their
side. They <i>did</i> have the range first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should tell that to your father, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad runs sheep on the range to protect himself.
He doesn&#8217;t drive out other people&#8217;s cattle and take
away their living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I might compromise, but not at the end
of a gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not. Here comes dad now,&#8221; she
added hurriedly, aware for the first time that she
had been holding an extended conversation with
her father&#8217;s foe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We started enemies and we quit enemies. Will
you shake hands on that, Miss Lee?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She held out her hand, then drew it swiftly back.
&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. I forgot. There&#8217;s another reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another reason! You mean the Arkansas
charge against me?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t tell you what it is.&#8221; She felt herself
suffused in a crimson glow. How could she
explain that she could not touch hands with him
because she had robbed him of twenty thousand
dollars?</p>
<p>Lee stopped at the steps, astonished to see his
daughter and this man in talk together. Yesterday
he would have resented it bitterly, but now the situation
was changed. Something of so much greater
magnitude had occurred that he was too perturbed
to cherish his feud for the present. All night he
had carried with him the dreadful secret he suspected.
He could not look Melissy in the face, nor
could he discuss the robbery with anybody. The
one fact that overshadowed all others was that his
little girl had gone out and held up a stage, that
if she were discovered she would be liable to a term
in the penitentiary. Laboriously his slow brain had
worked it all out. A talk with Jim Budd had confirmed
his conclusions. He knew that she had taken
this risk in order to save him. He was bowed down
with his unworthiness, with shame that he had
dragged her into this horrible tangle. He was convinced
that Jack Flatray would get at the truth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
and already he was resolved to come forward and
claim the whole affair as his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been apologizing to Mr. Morse for insulting
him, dad,&#8221; the girl said immediately.</p>
<p>Her father passed a bony hand slowly across his
unshaven chin. &#8220;That&#8217;s right, honey. If you done
him a meanness, you had ought to say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has said so very handsomely, Mr. Lee,&#8221;
spoke up Morse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been warning him, dad, that he ought to
be more careful how he rides around alone, with
the cattlemen feeling the way they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fact they feel right hot under the collar.
You&#8217;re ce&#8217;tainly a temptation to them, Mr. Morse,&#8221;
the girl&#8217;s father agreed.</p>
<p>The mine owner shifted the subject of conversation.
He was not a man of many impulses, but he
yielded to one now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we straighten out this trouble between us,
Mr. Lee? You think I&#8217;ve done you an injury. Perhaps
I have. If we both mean what&#8217;s right, we can
get together and fix it up in a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old Southerner stiffened and met him with
an eye of jade. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t asking any favors of you,
Mr. Morse. We&#8217;ll settle this matter some day, and
settle it right. But you can&#8217;t buy me off. I&#8217;ll not
take a bean from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The miner&#8217;s eyes hardened. &#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to
buy you off. I made a fair offer of peace. Since
you have rejected it, there is nothing more to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
said.&#8221; With that he bowed stiffly and walked away,
leading his horse.</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s gaze followed him and slowly the eyes
under the beetled brows softened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I done wrong, honey. Mebbe I&#8217;d ought
to have given in. I&#8217;m too proud to compromise
when he&#8217;s got me beat. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s ailin&#8217; with
me. But I reckon I&#8217;d better have knuckled under.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl slipped her arm through his. &#8220;Sometimes
I&#8217;m just like that too, daddy. I&#8217;ve just <i>got</i>
to win before I make up. I don&#8217;t blame you a mite,
but, all the same, we should have let him fix it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of them both that neither
thought of reversing the decision he had made. It
was done now, and they would abide by the results.
But already both of them half regretted, though
for very different reasons. Lee was thinking that
for Melissy&#8217;s sake he should have made a friend of
the man he hated, since it was on the cards that
within a few days she might be in his power. The
girl&#8217;s feeling, too, was unselfish. She could not forget
the deep hunger for friendship that had shone
in the man&#8217;s eyes. He was alone in the world, a
strong man surrounded by enemies who would
probably destroy him in the end. There was stirring
in her heart a sweet womanly pity and sympathy
for the enemy whose proffer of friendship had
been so cavalierly rejected.</p>
<p>The sight of a horseman riding down the trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
from the Flagstaff mine shook Melissy into alertness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, dad. It&#8217;s Mr. Norris,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Morse, who had not yet recognized him, swung
to the saddle, his heart full of bitterness. Every
man&#8217;s hand was against his, and every woman&#8217;s.
What was there in his nature that turned people
against him so inevitably? There seemed to be some
taint in him that corroded all natural human kindness.</p>
<p>A startled oath brought him from his somber reflections.
He looked up, to see the face of a man
with whom in the dead years of the past he had
been in bitter feud.</p>
<p>Neither of them spoke. Morse looked at him
with a face cold as chiselled marble and as hard.
The devil&#8217;s own passion burned in the storm-tossed
one of the other.</p>
<p>Norris was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was all a lie about your being killed, Dick
Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mine owner did not speak, but the rigor of
his eyes did not relax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gave it out to throw me off your trail, did you?
Knew mighty well I&#8217;d cut the heart out of the man
who shot poor Shep.&#8221; The voice of the cattle detective
rang out in malignant triumph. &#8220;You
guessed it c&#8217;rect, seh. Right here&#8217;s where the
Boone-Bellamy feud claims another victim.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men were sitting face to face, so close that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
their knees almost touched. As Norris jerked out
his gun Bellamy caught his wrist. They struggled
for an instant, the one to free his arm, the other to
retain his grip. Bellamy spurred his horse closer.
The more powerful of the two, he slowly twisted
around the imprisoned wrist. Inch by inch the revolver
swung in a jerky, spasmodic circle. There
was a moment when it pointed directly at the mine
owner&#8217;s heart. His enemy&#8217;s finger crooked on the
trigger, eyes passionate with the stark lust to kill.
But the pressure on the wrist had numbed the hand.
The weapon jumped out of line, went clattering
down into the dust from the palsied fingers.</p>
<p>Lee ran forward and pushed between the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here. Ain&#8217;t you boys got ary bettah sense than
to clinch like wildcats?&#8221; he demanded, jerking one
of the horses away by the bridle. &#8220;No, you don&#8217;t,
Phil. I&#8217;ll take keer of this gun for the present.&#8221;
It was noticeable that Beauchamp Lee&#8217;s speech
grew more after the manner of the plantations
when he became excited.</p>
<p>The cowpuncher, white with anger, glared at his
enemy and poured curses at him, the while he
nursed his strained wrist. For the moment he was
impotent, but he promised himself vengeance in full
when they should meet again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be enough from you now, Phil,&#8221; said
the old ex-Confederate good-naturedly, leading him
toward the house and trying to soothe his malevolent
chagrin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>Bellamy turned and rode away. At the corner
of the corral he met Jack Flatray riding up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been having a little difference of opinion with
our friend, haven&#8217;t you, seh?&#8221; the deputy asked
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Bellamy gave him only the crisp monosyllable
and changed the subject immediately.
&#8220;What about this stage robbery? Have you been
able to make anything of it, Mr. Flatray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes. I reckon we&#8217;ll be able to land the
miscreant mebbe, if things come our way,&#8221; drawled
the deputy. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be a good idea to offer
a reward, though, to keep things warm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of that. I made it a thousand dollars.
The posters ought to be out to-day on the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom do you suspect?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked at him with amiable imperturbability.
&#8220;I reckon I better certify my suspicions, seh, before
I go to shouting them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir. Since I&#8217;m paying the shot, it
ought to entitle me to some confidence. But it&#8217;s up
to you. Get back the twenty thousand dollars,
that&#8217;s all I ask, except that you put the fellow behind
the bars of the penitentiary for a few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatray gave him an odd smile which he did not
understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope to be able to accommodate you, seh, about
this time to-morrow, so far as getting the gold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
goes. You&#8217;ll have to wait a week or two before
the rest of your expectations get gratified.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any reasonable time. I want to see him there
eventually. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack laughed again, without giving any reason
for his mirth. That ironic smile continued to decorate
his face for some time. He seemed to have
some inner source of mirth he did not care to disclose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE DANGER LINE</h3>
</div>

<p>Though Champ Lee had business in Mesa
next day that would not be denied, he was
singularly loath to leave the ranch. He
wanted to stay close to Melissy until the dénouement
of the hunt for the stage robber. On the
other hand, it was well known that his contest with
Morse for the Monte Cristo was up for a hearing.
To stay at home would have been a confession of
his anxiety that he did not want to make. But it
was only after repeated charges to his daughter to
call him up by telephone immediately if anything
happened that he could bring himself to ride away.</p>
<p>He was scarcely out of sight when a Mexican
vaquero rode in with the information that old Antonio,
on his way to the post at Three Pines with
a second drove of sheep, had twisted his ankle badly
about fifteen miles from the ranch. After trying
in vain to pick up a herder at Mesa by telephone,
Melissy was driven to the only feasible course left
her, to make the drive herself in place of Antonio.
There were fifteen hundred sheep in the bunch, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
they must be taken care of at once by somebody
competent for the task. She knew she could handle
them, for it had amused her to take charge of a
herd often for an hour or two at a time. The long
stretch over the desert would be wearisome and
monotonous, but she had the slim, muscular tenacity
of a half-grown boy. It did not matter what
she wanted to do. The thing to which she came
back always was that the sheep must be taken
care of.</p>
<p>She left directions with Jim for taking care of
the place, changed to a khaki skirt and jacket,
slapped a saddle on her bronco, and disappeared
across country among the undulations of the sandhills.
A tenderfoot would have been hopelessly lost
in the sameness of these hills and washes, but Melissy
knew them as a city dweller does his streets.
Straight as an arrow she went to her mark. The
tinkle of distant sheep-bells greeted her after some
hours&#8217; travel, and soon the low, ceaseless bleating
of the herd.</p>
<p>The girl found Antonio propped against a piñon
tree, solacing himself philosophically with cigarettes.
He was surprised to see her, but made only
a slight objection to her taking his place. His
ankle was paining him a good deal, and he was very
glad to get the chance to pull himself to her saddle
and ride back to the ranch.</p>
<p>A few quick words sent the dog Colin out among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the sheep, by now scattered far and wide over the
hill. They presently came pouring toward her,
diverged westward, and massed at the base of a
butte rising from a dry arroyo. The journey had
begun, and hour after hour it continued through
the hot day, always in a cloud of dust flung up by
the sheep, sometimes through the heavy sand of a
wash, often over slopes of shale, not seldom through
thick cactus beds that shredded her skirt and tore
like fierce, sharp fingers at her legging-protected
ankles. The great gray desert still stretched before
her to the horizon&#8217;s edge, and still she flung the
miles behind her with the long, rhythmic stride that
was her birthright from the hills. A strong man,
unused to it, would have been staggering with stiff
fatigue, but this slender girl held the trail with
light grace, her weight still carried springily on her
small ankles.</p>
<p>Once she rested for a few minutes, flinging herself
down into the sand at length, her head thrown
back from the full brown throat so that she could
gaze into the unstained sky of blue. Presently the
claims of this planet made themselves heard, for
she, too, was elemental and a creature of instinct.
The earth was awake and palpitating with life, the
low, indefatigable life of creeping things and vegetation
persisting even in this waste of rock and
sand.</p>
<p>But she could not rest long, for Diablo Cañon
must be reached before dark. The sheep would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
very thirsty by the time they arrived, and she could
not risk letting them tear down the precipitous edge
among the sharp rocks in the dark. Already over
the sand stretches a peculiar liquid glow was flooding,
so that the whole desert seemed afire. The
burning sun had slipped behind a saddle of the purple
peaks, leaving a brilliant horizon of many
mingled shades.</p>
<p>It was as she came forward to the cañon&#8217;s edge
in this luminous dusk that Melissy became aware
of a distant figure on horseback, silhouetted for a
moment against the skyline. One glance was all
she got of it, for she was very busy with the sheep,
working them leisurely toward the black chasm that
seemed to yawn for them. High rock walls girt
the cañon, gigantic and bottomless in the gloom.
A dizzy trail zigzagged back and forth to the pool
below, and along this she and the collie skilfully
sent the eager, thirsty animals.</p>
<p>The mass of the sheep were still huddled on the
edge of the ravine when there came the thud of
horses&#8217; hoofs and the crack of revolvers, accompanied
by hoarse, triumphant yells and cries. Melissy
knew instantly what it was&mdash;the attack of cattlemen
upon her defenseless flock. They had waited
until the sheep were on the edge of the precipice,
and now they were going to drive the poor creatures
down upon the rocks two hundred feet below.
Her heart leaped to her throat, but scarce more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
quickly than she upon a huge boulder bordering
the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back! Keep back!&#8221; she heard herself crying,
and even as she spoke a bullet whistled through the
rim of her felt hat.</p>
<p>Standing there boldly, unconscious of danger, the
wind draped and defined the long lines of her figure
like those of the Winged Victory.</p>
<p>The foremost rider galloped past, waving his
sombrero and shooting into the frightened mass in
front of him. Within a dozen feet of her he turned
his revolver upon the girl, then, with an oath of
recognition, dragged his pony back upon its
haunches. Another horse slithered into it, and a
third.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;Lissie Lee!&#8221; a voice cried in astonishment;
and another, with a startled oath, &#8220;You&#8217;re right,
Bob!&#8221;</p>
<p>The first rider gave his pony the spur, swung it
from the trail in a half-circle which brought it back
at the very edge of the ravine, and blocked the forward
pour of terror-stricken sheep. Twice his revolver
rang out. The girl&#8217;s heart stood still, for
the man was Norris, and it seemed for an instant
as if he must be swept over the precipice by the
stampede. The leaders braced themselves to
stop, but were slowly pushed forward toward
the edge. One of the other riders had by this
time joined the daring cowpuncher, and together
they stemmed the tide. The pressure on the trail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
relaxed and the sheep began to mill around and
around.</p>
<p>It was many minutes before they were sufficiently
quieted to trust upon the trail again, but at last the
men got them safely to the bottom, with the exception
of two or three killed in the descent.</p>
<p>Her responsibility for the safety of the sheep
gone, the girl began to crawl down the dark trail.
She could not see a yard in front of her, and at
each step the path seemed to end in a gulf of darkness.
She could not be sure she was on the trail
at all, and her nerve was shaken by the experience
through which she had just passed. Presently she
stopped and waited, for the first time in her life
definitely and physically afraid. She stood there
trembling, a long, long time it seemed to her, surrounded
by the impenetrable blackness of night.</p>
<p>Then a voice came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melissy!&#8221;</p>
<p>She answered, and the voice came slowly nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off the trail,&#8221; it told her presently, just
before a human figure defined itself in the gloom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; she sobbed.</p>
<p>A strong hand came from nowhere and caught
hers. An arm slipped around her waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be afraid, little girl. I&#8217;ll see no harm
comes to you,&#8221; the man said to her with a quick,
fierce tenderness.</p>
<p>The comfort of his support was unspeakable. It
stole into her heart like water to the roots of thirsty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
plants. To feel her head against his shoulder, to
know he held her tight, meant safety and life. He
had told her not to be afraid, and she was so no
longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shot at me,&#8221; she murmured in reproach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know. We thought it was Bellamy&#8217;s
herd. But it&#8217;s true, God forgive me! I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was in his voice the warm throb of emotion,
and in his eyes something she had never seen
before in those of any human being. Like stars
they were, swimming in light, glowing with the
exultation of the triumph he was living. She was
a splendid young animal, untaught of life, generous,
passionate, tempestuous, and as her pliant, supple
body lay against his some sex instinct old as
creation stirred potently within her. She had found
her mate. It came to her as innocently as the same
impulse comes to the doe when the spring freshets
are seeking the river, and as innocently her lips
met his in their first kiss of surrender. Something
irradiated her, softened her, warmed her. Was it
love? She did not know, but as yet she was still
happy in the glow of it.</p>
<p>Slowly, hand in hand, they worked back to the
trail and down it to the bottom of the cañon. The
soft velvet night enwrapped them. It shut them
from the world and left them one to one. From
the meeting palms strange electric currents tingled
through the girl and flushed her to an ecstasy of
emotion.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>A camp fire was already burning cheerfully when
they reached the base of the descent. A man came
forward to meet them. He glanced curiously at
the girl after she came within the circle of light.
Her eyes were shining as from some inner glow,
and she was warm with a soft color that vitalized
her beauty. Then his gaze passed to take in with
narrowed lids her companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you found her,&#8221; he said dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I found her, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered the spirit of Farnum&#8217;s words rather
than the letter of them, nor could he keep out of
his bearing and his handsome face the exultation
that betrayed success.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;mp!&#8221; Farnum turned from him and addressed
the girl: &#8220;I suppose Norris has explained
our mistake and eaten crow for all of us, Miss Lee.
I don&#8217;t see how come we to make such a blame&#8217;
fool mistake. It was gitting dark, and we took
your skirt for a greaser&#8217;s blanket. It&#8217;s ce&#8217;tainly
on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has explained.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there won&#8217;t any amount of explaining
square the thing. We might &#8217;a&#8217; done you a terrible
injury, Miss Lee. It was gilt-edged luck for
us that you thought to jump on that rock and
holler.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the sheep,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you saved them, and I&#8217;m right glad of it.
We ain&#8217;t got any use for Mary&#8217;s little trotter, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
your father&#8217;s square about his. He keeps them
herded up on his own range. We may not like it,
but we ce&#8217;tainly aren&#8217;t going to the length of attackin&#8217;
his herd.&#8221; Farnum&#8217;s gaze took in her slender
girlishness, and he voiced the question in his
mind. &#8220;How in time do you happen to be sheep-herding
all by your lone a thousand miles from nowhere,
Miss Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>She explained the circumstances after she had
moved forward to warm herself by the fire. For
already night was bringing a chill breeze with it.
The man cooking the coffee looked up and nodded
pleasantly, continuing his work. Norris dragged
up a couple of saddle blankets and spread them on
the ground for her to sit upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to do a thing but boss this outfit,&#8221;
he told her with his gay smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re queen
of the range to-night, and we&#8217;re your herders or
your punchers, whichever you want to call us. To-morrow
morning two of us are going to drive these
sheep on to the trading post for you, and the other
one is going to see you safe back home. It&#8217;s all
arranged.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were as good as his word. She could not
move from her place to help herself. It was their
pleasure to wait upon her as if she had really been
a queen and they her subjects. Melissy was very
tired, but she enjoyed their deference greatly. She
was still young enough to find delight in the fact
that three young and more or less good-looking men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
were vying with each other to anticipate her needs.</p>
<p>Like them, she ate and drank ravenously of the
sandwiches and the strong coffee, though before the
meal was over she found herself nodding drowsily.
The tactful courtesy of these rough fellows was perfect.
They got the best they had for her of their
blankets, dragged a piñon root to feed the glowing
coals, and with cheerful farewells of &#8220;<i>Buenos
Noches</i>&#8221; retired around a bend in the cañon and
lit another fire for themselves.</p>
<p>The girl snuggled down into the warmth of the
blankets and stretched her weary limbs in delicious
rest. She did not mean to go to sleep for a long
time. She had much to think about. So she looked
up the black sheer cañon walls to the deep blue,
starry sky above, and relived her day in memory.</p>
<p>A strange excitement tingled through her, born
of shame and shyness and fear, and of something
else she did not understand, something which had
lain banked in her nature like a fire since childhood
and now threw forth its first flame of heat. What
did it mean, that passionate fierceness with which
her lips had clung to his? She liked him, of course,
but surely liking would not explain the pulse that
her first kiss had sent leaping through her blood
like wine. Did she love him?</p>
<p>Then why did she distrust him? Why was there
fear in her sober second thought of him? Had
she done wrong? For the moment all her maiden
defenses had been wiped out and he had ridden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
roughshod over her reserves. But somewhere in
her a bell of warning was ringing. The poignant
sting of sex appeal had come home to her for the
first time. Wherefore in this frank child of the
wilderness had been born a shy shame, a vague
trembling for herself that marked a change. At
sunrise she had been still treading gayly the primrose
path of childhood; at sunset she had entered
upon her heritage of womanhood.</p>
<p>The sun had climbed high and was peering down
the walls of the gulch when she awoke. She did
not at once realize where she was, but came presently
to a blinking consciousness of her surroundings.
The rock wall on one side was still shadowed,
while the painted side of the other was warm with
the light which poured upon it. The Gothic spires,
the Moorish domes, the weird and mysterious caves,
which last night had given more than a touch of
awe to her majestic bedchamber, now looked a good
deal less like the ruins of mediæval castles and the
homes of elfin sprites and gnomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos dios, muchacha,</i>&#8221; a voice called cheerfully
to her.</p>
<p>She did not need to turn to know to whom it
belonged. Among a thousand she would have recognized
its tone of vibrant warmth.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Buenos,</i>&#8221; she answered, and, rising hurriedly,
she fled to rearrange her hair and dress.</p>
<p>It was nearly a quarter of an hour later that she
reappeared, her thick coils of ebon-hued tresses shining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
in the sun, her skirt smoothed to her satisfaction,
and the effects of feminine touches otherwise
visible upon her fresh, cool person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast is served,&#8221; Norris sang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dinner would be nearer it,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;Why
in the world didn&#8217;t you boys waken me? What
time is it, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very late&mdash;a little past noon maybe.
You were all tired out with your tramp yesterday.
I didn&#8217;t see why you shouldn&#8217;t have your sleep out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was pouring a cup of black coffee for her
from the smoky pot, and she looked around expectantly
for the others. Simultaneously she remembered
that she had not heard the bleating of the
sheep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the others&mdash;Mr. Farnum and Sam?
And have you the sheep all gagged?&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>He gave her that odd look of smoldering eyes
behind half-shut lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys have gone on to finish the drive for
you. They started before sun-up this morning.
I&#8217;m elected to see you back home safely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her protest died unspoken. She could not very
well frame it in words, and before his bold, possessive
eyes the girl&#8217;s long, dark lashes wavered to
the cheeks into which the hot blood was beating.
Nevertheless, the feeling existed that she wished
one of the others had stayed instead of him. It
was born, no doubt, partly of the wave of shyness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
running through her, but partly too of instinctive
maidenly resistance to something in his look, in the
assurance of his manner, that seemed to claim too
much. Last night he had taken her by storm and
at advantage. Something of shame stirred in her
that he had found her so easy a conquest, something
too of a new vague fear of herself. She resented
the fact that he could so move her, even though
she still felt the charm of his personal presence.
She meant to hold herself in abeyance, to make
sure of herself and of him before she went further.</p>
<p>But the cowpuncher had no intention of letting
her regain so fully control of her emotions. Experience
of more than one young woman had taught
him that scruples were likely to assert themselves
after reflection, and he purposed giving her no time
for that to-day.</p>
<p>He did not count in vain upon the intimacy of
companionship forced upon them by the circumstances,
nor upon the skill with which he knew
how to make the most of his manifold attractions.
His rôle was that of the comrade, gay with good
spirits and warm with friendliness, solicitous of her
needs, but not oppressively so. If her glimpse of
him at breakfast had given the girl a vague alarm,
she laughed her fears away later before his open
good humor.</p>
<p>There had been a time when he had been a part
of that big world &#8220;back in the States,&#8221; peopled so
generously by her unfettered imagination. He knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
how to talk, and entertainingly, of books and people,
of events and places he had known. She had
not knowledge enough of life to doubt his stories,
nor did she resent it that he spoke of this her native
section with the slighting manner of one who patronized
it with his presence. Though she loved
passionately her Arizona, she guessed its crudeness,
and her fancy magnified the wonders of that southern
civilization from which it was so far cut off.</p>
<p>Farnum had left his horse for the girl, and after
breakfast the cowpuncher saddled the broncos and
brought them up. Melissy had washed the dishes,
filled his canteen, and packed the saddle bags. Soon
they were off, climbing slowly the trail that led up
the cañon wall. She saw the carcass of a dead
sheep lying on the rocks half way down the cliff,
and had spoken of it before she could stop herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that? Isn&#8217;t it&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks to me like a boulder,&#8221; lied her escort unblushingly.
There was no use, he judged, in recalling
unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>Nor did she long remember. The dry, exhilarating
sunshine and the sting of gentle, wide-swept
breezes, the pleasure of swift motion and the ring
of that exultingly boyish voice beside her, combined
to call the youth in her to rejoice. Firm in the saddle
she rode, as graceful a picture of piquant girlhood
as could be conceived, thrilling to the silent
voices of the desert. They traveled in a sunlit sea
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
of space, under a sky of blue, in which tenuous
cloud lakes floated. Once they came on a small
bunch of hill cattle which went flying like deer into
the covert of a draw. A rattlesnake above a prairie
dog&#8217;s hole slid into the mesquit. A swift watched
them from the top of a smooth rock, motionless so
long as they could see. She loved it all, this immense,
deserted world of space filled with its multitudinous
dwellers.</p>
<p>They unsaddled at Dead Cow Creek, hobbled the
ponies, and ate supper. Norris seemed in no hurry
to resaddle. He lay stretched carelessly at full
length, his eyes upon her with veiled admiration.
She sat upright, her gaze on the sunset with its
splashes of topaz and crimson and saffron, watching
the tints soften and mellow as dusk fell. Every
minute now brought its swift quota of changing
beauty. A violet haze enveloped the purple mountains,
and in the crotch of the hills swam a lake of
indigo. The raw, untempered glare of the sun was
giving place to a limitless pour of silvery moonlight.</p>
<p>Her eyes were full of the soft loveliness of the
hour when she turned them upon her companion.
He answered promptly her unspoken question.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it is! A night for the gods&mdash;or for
lovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it in a murmur, his eyes full on hers,
and his look wrenched her from her mood. The
mask of comradeship was gone. He looked at her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
hungrily, as might a lover to whom all spiritual
heights were denied.</p>
<p>Her sooty lashes fell before this sinister spirit
she had evoked, but were raised instantly at the
sound of him drawing his body toward her. Inevitably
there was a good deal of the young animal in
her superbly healthy body. She had been close to
nature all day, the riotous passion of spring flowing
free in her as in the warm earth herself. But the
magic of the mystic hills had lifted her beyond the
merely personal. Some sense of grossness in him
for the first time seared across her brain. She
started up, and her face told him she had taken
alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must be going,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>He got to his feet. &#8220;No hurry, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The look in his face startled her. It was new
to her in her experience of men. Never before had
she met elemental lust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re near enough,&#8221; she cautioned sharply.</p>
<p>He cursed softly his maladroitness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was nearer last night, honey,&#8221; he reminded
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night isn&#8217;t to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hesitated. Should he rush her defenses, bury
her protests in kisses? Or should he talk her out
of this harsh mood? Last night she had been his.
There were moments during the day when she had
responded to him as a musical instrument does to
skilled fingers. But for the moment his power
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
over her was gone. And he was impatient of delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221; he asked roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll start at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frightened though she was, her gaze held steadily
to his. It was the same instinct in her that
makes one look a dangerous wild beast straight in
the eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s got into you?&#8221; he demanded sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon not just yet. It&#8217;s my say-so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare stop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passion in him warred with prudence. He
temporized. &#8220;Why, honey! I&#8217;m the man that loves
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would not see his outstretched hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then saddle my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, no! You&#8217;re going to listen to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>His anger ripped out unexpectedly, even to him.
Whatever fear she felt, the girl crushed down. He
must not know her heart was drowned in terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll listen after we&#8217;ve started.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cursed her fickleness. &#8220;What&#8217;s ailin&#8217; you,
girl? I ain&#8217;t a man to be put off this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget you&#8217;re in Arizona,&#8221; she warned.</p>
<p>He understood what she meant. In the ranch
country no man could with impunity insult a woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>Standing defiantly before him, her pliant form
very straight, the underlying blood beating softly
under the golden brown of her cheeks, one of the
thick braids of her heavy, blue-black hair falling
across the breast that rose and fell a little fast, she
was no less than a challenge of Nature to him. He
looked into a mobile face as daring and as passionate
as his own, warm with the life of innocent
youth, and the dark blood mantled his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saddle the horses,&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get good and ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am. We&#8217;re going to have a talk first.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked across to the place where her pony
grazed, slipped on the bridle, and brought the animal
back to the saddle. Norris watched her fitting
the blankets and tightening the cinch without a
word, his face growing blacker every moment. Before
she could start he strode forward and caught
the rein.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to say to you,&#8221; he told her
rudely. &#8220;You&#8217;re not going now. So that&#8217;s all
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips tightened. &#8220;Let go of my horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think you can force me to stay here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to hear what I&#8217;ve got to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bully!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell what I know&mdash;Miss Hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell it!&#8221; she cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></p>
<p>He laughed harshly, his narrowed eyes watching
her closely. &#8220;If you throw me down now, I&#8217;ll
ce&#8217;tainly tell it. Be reasonable, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go my rein!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this. Tumble off that horse,
or I&#8217;ll pull you off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dark eyes flashed scorn of him. &#8220;You coward!
Do you think I&#8217;m afraid of you? Stand
back!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked long at her, his teeth set; then
caught at her strong little wrist. With a quick
wrench she freed it, her eyes glowing like live
coals.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dare!&#8221; she panted.</p>
<p>Her quirt rose and fell, the lash burning his wrist
like a band of fire. With a furious oath he dropped
his hand from the rein. Like a flash she was off,
had dug her heels home, and was galloping into
the moonlight recklessly as fast as she could send
forward her pony. Stark terror had her by the
throat. The fear of him flooded her whole being.
Not till the drumming hoofs had carried her far
did other emotions move her.</p>
<p>She was furious with him, and with herself for
having been imposed upon by him. His beauty, his
grace, his debonair manner&mdash;they were all hateful
to her now. She had thought him a god among
men, and he was of common clay. It was her vanity
that was wounded, not her heart. She scourged herself
because she had been so easily deceived, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
she had let herself become a victim of his good
looks and his impudence. For that she had let him
kiss her&mdash;yes, and had returned his kiss&mdash;she was
heartily contemptuous of herself. Always she had
held herself with an instinctive pride, but in her passion
of abandonment the tears confessed now that
this pride had been humbled to the dust.</p>
<p>This gusty weather of the spirit, now of chastened
pride and now of bitter anger, carried her
even through the group of live-oaks which looked
down upon the silent houses of the ranch, lying in
a sea of splendid moon-beat. She was so much less
confident of herself than usual that she made up her
mind to tell her father the whole story of the hold-up
and of what this man had threatened.</p>
<p>This resolution comforted her, and it was with
something approaching calmness that she rode past
the corral fence and swung from the saddle in front
of the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>JACK GOES TO THE HEAD OF THE CLASS</h3>
</div>

<p>She trailed the bridle reins, went up the porch
steps, and drew off her gauntlets. Her hand
was outstretched to open the door when her
gaze fell upon a large bill tacked to the wall.
Swiftly she read it through, and, having read it,
remained in suspended motion. For the first time
she fully realized the danger and the penalty that
confronted her.</p>
<div class='ce'>
<p>ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Will Be Paid By Thomas L. Morse</span></p>
</div>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>For the arrest and conviction of each of
the men who were implicated in the robbery
of the Fort Allison stage on April
twenty-seventh last. A further reward of
$1000 will be paid for the recovery of the
bullion stolen.</p>
</div>
<p>This was what she read, and her eye was running
over it a second time when she heard the
jingle of a spur approaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re red-hot after them, you see, Miss Lee,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
a mocking voice drawled. &#8220;If you want to round
up a thousand plunks, all you&#8217;ve got to do is to tell
me who Mr. Hold-up is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed quietly, as if it were a joke, but the
girl answered with a flush. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I knew, do you suppose I would tell for five
thousand&mdash;or ten thousand?&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason this seemed to give him sardonic
amusement. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t suppose you
would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to catch him yourself if you want
him. I&#8217;m not in that business, Mr. Flatray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am. Sorry you don&#8217;t like the business, Miss
Lee.&#8221; He added dryly: &#8220;But then you always
were hard to please. You weren&#8217;t satisfied when
I was a rustler.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes swept him with a look, whether of reproach
or contempt he was not sure. But the hard
derision of his gaze did not soften. Mentally as
well as physically he was a product of the sun and
the wind, as tough and unyielding as a greasewood
sapling. For a friend he would go the limit, and
he could not forgive her that she had distrusted
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But mebbe you&#8217;d prefer it if I was rustling
stages,&#8221; he went on, looking straight at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to have a talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we step around to the side of the house.
We&#8217;ll be freer from interruption there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way, taking her consent for granted.
With him he carried a chair for her from the
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll be as brief as possible, Mr. Flatray.
I&#8217;ve been in the desert two days and want to change
my clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not detain you. It&#8217;s about this gold robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not take her eyes from him. Something
told her that he knew her secret, or part of
it. Her heart was fluttering like a caged thrush.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we begin at the beginning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or in the middle, say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If only you&#8217;ll begin anywhere,&#8221; she said impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;How will this do for a beginning, then? &#8216;One
thousand dollars will be paid by Thomas L. Morse
for the arrest and conviction of each of the men
who were implicated in the robbery of the Fort
Allison stage on April twenty-seventh last.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She was shaken, there was no denying it. He
could see the ebb of blood from her cheeks, the
sudden stiffening of the slender figure.</p>
<p>She did not speak until she had control of her
voice. &#8220;Dear me! What has all that to do with
me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A good deal, I&#8217;m afraid. You know how much,
better than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&#8217;m stupid. You&#8217;ll have to be a great
deal clearer before I can understand you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve noticed that it&#8217;s a lot easier to understand
what you want to than what you don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sharply a thought smote her. &#8220;Have you seen
Phil Norris lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t. Do you think it likely that he
would confess?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confess?&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see I&#8217;ll have to start at the beginning, after
all. It&#8217;s pretty hard to say just where that is. It
might be when Morse got hold of your father&#8217;s
claim, or another fellow might say it was when
the Boone-Bellamy feud began, and that is a mighty
long time ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Boone-Bellamy feud,&#8221; echoed the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The real name of our friend Norris is
Dunc Boone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no friend of mine.&#8221; She flamed it out
with such intensity that he was surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it. I can tell you, then, that he&#8217;s
a bad lot. He was driven out of Arkansas after
a suspected murder. It was a killing from ambush.
They couldn&#8217;t quite hang it on him, but he lit a
shuck to save his skin from lynchers. At that time
he was a boy. Couldn&#8217;t have been more than seventeen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did he kill?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;One of the Bellamy faction. The real name of
T. L. Morse is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;Richard Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; he asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known it since the first day I met him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Known that he was wanted for murder in Arkansas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you protected him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a reason.&#8221; She did not explain that her
reason was Jack Flatray, between whom and the
consequences of his rustling she had stood.</p>
<p>He pondered that a moment. &#8220;Well, Morse, or
Bellamy, told me all about it. Now that Boone
has recognized him, the game is up. He&#8217;s ready
to go back and stand trial if he must. I&#8217;ve communicated
with the authorities in Arkansas and
I&#8217;ll hear from them in a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has this to do with the hold-up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, the hold-up. Well, this fellow
Boone got your father to drinking, and then sprung
it on him to rob the stage when the bullion was
being shipped. Somehow Boone had got inside information
about when this was to be. He had been
nosing around up at the mine, and may have overheard
something. O&#8217; course we know what your
father would have done if he hadn&#8217;t been drinking.
He&#8217;s straight as a string, even if he does go off like
powder. But when a man&#8217;s making a blue blotter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
of himself, things don&#8217;t look the same to him. Anyhow
he went in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t. I can prove he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; burst from
Melissy&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be glad to hear your proof later. He ce&#8217;tainly
planned the hold-up. Jim Budd overheard him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Jim tell you that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame him for that. He didn&#8217;t mean to
tell, but I wound him up so he couldn&#8217;t get away
from it. I&#8217;ll show you later why he couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you must have been very busy, spying
and everything,&#8221; she told him bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept moving. But to get back to the point.
Your father and Boone were on the ground where
the stage was robbed <i>either at the time or right
after</i>. Their tracks were all over there. Then they
got on their horses and rode up the lateral.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they couldn&#8217;t. The ditch was full,&#8221; broke
from the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right it was. You must be some observing
to know when that ditch is full and empty to
an hour. I reckon you&#8217;ve got an almanac of tides,&#8221;
he said ironically.</p>
<p>She bit her lip with chagrin. &#8220;I just happened
to notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some folks <i>are</i> more noticing than others. But
you&#8217;re surely right. They came up the ditch one on
each side. Now, why one on each side, do you
reckon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy hid the dread that was flooding her heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know. You know everything
else. I suppose you do that, too, if they really did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had their reasons, but we won&#8217;t go into
that now. First off when they reach the house
they take a bunch of sheep down to the ditch to
water them. Now, why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, unless because they needed water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll let that go into the discard too just now.
Let&#8217;s suppose your father and Boone dumped the
gold box down into the creek somewhere after they
had robbed the stage. Suppose they had a partner
up at the head-gates. When the signal is given
down comes the water, and the box is covered by
it. Mebbe that night they take it away and bury
it somewhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl began to breathe again. He knew a
good deal, but he was still off the track in the main
points.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who is this partner up at the canal? Have
you got him located too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;&mdash;impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young lady hailing from this <i>hacienda</i> was
out gathering flowers all mo&#8217;ning. She was in her
runabout. The tracks led straight from here to
the head-gates. I followed them through the sands.
There&#8217;s a little break in one of the rubber tires.
You&#8217;ll find that break mark every eight feet or so
in the sand wash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I opened the head-gates, then, did I?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It looks that way, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At a signal from father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s all the evidence you&#8217;ve got against
him and me?&#8221; she demanded, still outwardly scornful,
but very much afraid at heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, that ain&#8217;t all, Miss Lee. Somebody
locked the Chink in during this play. He&#8217;s still
wondering why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He dreamed it. Very likely he had been rolling
a pill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I dream this too?&#8221; From his coat pocket
he drew the piece of black shirting she had used as
a mask. &#8220;I found it in the room where your father
put me up that first night I stayed here. It was
your brother Dick&#8217;s room, and this came from the
pocket of a shirt hanging in the closet. Now, who
do you reckon put it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in her life she knew what it
was to feel faint. She tried to speak, but the words
would not come from her parched throat. How
could he be so hard and cruel, this man who had
once been her best friend? How could he stand
there so like a machine in his relentlessness?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we used to&mdash;to play at hold-up when he
was a boy,&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;No, I reckon that won&#8217;t go.
You see, I&#8217;ve found the piece this was torn from,
<i>and I found it in your father&#8217;s coat</i>. I went into
his room on tiptoe that same hour. The coat was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
on the bed. He had gone downstairs for a minute
and left it there. Likely he hadn&#8217;t found a good
chance to burn it yet.&#8221; Taking the two pieces, he
fitted them together and held them up. &#8220;They
match exactly, you see. Did your father used to
play with you too when he was a boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked this with what seemed to her tortured
soul like silken cruelty. She had no answer, none
at least that would avail. Desperately she snatched
at a straw.</p>
<p>&#8220;All this isn&#8217;t proof. It&#8217;s mere surmise. Some
one&#8217;s tracks were found by you. How do you know
they were father&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got that cinched too. I took his boots and
measured them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where&#8217;s the gold, if he took it? It must
be somewhere. Where is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;m going up to the head of the class,
ma&#8217;am. The gold&mdash;why, that&#8217;s a dead easy one.
<i>Near as I can make out, I&#8217;m sitting on it right now.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a startled little cry that died in her
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s ce&#8217;tainly a valuable wash-stand. Chippendale
furniture ain&#8217;t in it with this kind. I reckon
the king of England&#8217;s is ace high against a straight
flush when it bucks up against yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy threw up her cards. &#8220;How did you find
out?&#8221; she asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>The deputy forced her to commit herself more
definitely. &#8220;Find out what?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Where I put the box.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go back and answer some of those other
questions first. I might as well own up that I knew
all the time your father didn&#8217;t hold up the stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s no fool. He wouldn&#8217;t leave his tracks all
over the place where he had just held up a stage.
He might jest as well have left a signed note saying
he had done it. No, that didn&#8217;t look like Champ
Lee to me. It seemed more likely he&#8217;d arrived after
the show than before. It wouldn&#8217;t be like him,
either, to go plowing up the side of the ditch, with
his partner on the other side, making a trail that
a blind man could follow in the night. Soon as I
knew Lee and Boone made those tracks, I had it
cinched that they were following the lateral to see
where the robber was going. They had come to
the same conclusion I had, that there wasn&#8217;t any
way of escape <i>except by that empty lateral</i>, <i>assuming
it had been empty</i>. The only point was to find
out where the hold-up left the lateral. That&#8217;s why
they rode one on each side of it. They weren&#8217;t
missing any bets, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s why they drove the sheep down to
water&mdash;to hide the wheel-tracks. I couldn&#8217;t understand
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must &#8217;a&#8217; been right on their heels, for they
were jest getting the trotters out of the corral when
I reached the place where your rig left the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
&#8217;Course I fell back into the brush and circled around
so as to hit the store in front.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if dad knew all the time, I don&#8217;t see&mdash;surely,
he wouldn&#8217;t have come right after me and made
plain the way I escaped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the point. He didn&#8217;t know. I reckon
he was sort of guessing around in the dark, plumb
puzzled; couldn&#8217;t find the switch at all at first. Then
it come to him, and he thought of the sheep to
blind the trail. If I&#8217;d been half a hour later he
would have got away with it too. No, if he had
guessed that you were in the hold-up, him and
Boone would have hiked right out on a false trail
and led us into the Galiuros. Having no notion of
it at first, he trails you down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the gold&mdash;how did you find that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it was either right around the place or
else you had taken it on with you when you went
to the head-gates and buried it up there somewhere.
Next day I followed your tracks and couldn&#8217;t find
any place where you might have left it. I knew
how clever you were by the way you planned your
getaway. Struck me as mighty likely that you had
left it lying around in plain view somewhere. If
you had dumped it out of the box into a sack, the
box must be somewhere. You hadn&#8217;t had time to
burn it before the stage got back. I drifted back
to your kindling pile, where all the old boxes from
the store are lying. I happened to notice a brass
tack in one near the end; then the marks of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
tack heads where they had pressed against the wood.
I figured you might have substituted one box for
another, and inside of ten minutes I stumbled
against your wash-stand and didn&#8217;t budge it. Then
I didn&#8217;t have to look any further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to get a chance to move it and
haven&#8217;t ever found one. You were always coming
around the corner on me,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry I incommoded you,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s too heavy for a lady to lift alone, anyhow. I
don&#8217;t see how you managed it this far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty strong,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>
<p>She had no hope of escape from the net of evidence
in which he had entangled her. It was characteristic
of her that she would not stoop to tricks
to stir his pity. Deep in her heart she knew now
that she had wronged him when she had suspected
him of being a rustler. He <i>could</i> not be. It was
not in the man&#8217;s character. But she would ask no
mercy of him. All her pride rose to meet his. She
would show him how game she could be. What
she had sown she would reap. Nor would it have
been any use to beseech him to spare her. He was
a hard man, she told herself. Not even a fool
could have read any weakness in the quiet gray
eyes that looked so steadily into hers. In his voice
and movements there was a certain deliberation, but
this had nothing to do with indecision of character.
He would do his duty as he saw it, regardless
of whom it might affect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>Melissy stood before him in the unconscious attitude
of distinction she often fell into when she
was moved, head thrown back so as to bare the
rounded throat column, brown little hands folded
in front of her, erectly graceful in all her slender
lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with me?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>His stone-cold eyes met hers steadily. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t
my say-so. I&#8217;m going to put it up to Bellamy. I
don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, cold as his manner was, the heart of the
man leaped to her courage. He saw her worn out,
pathetically fearful, but she could face him with
that still little smile of hers. He longed to take
her in his arms, to tell her it would be all right&mdash;all
right.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing that troubles me. I don&#8217;t
know how father will take this. You know how
quick-tempered he is. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll shoot somebody
or do something rash when he finds out. You
must let me be alone with him when I tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;I been thinking of that myself.
It ain&#8217;t going to do him any good to make a gun-play.
I have a notion mebbe this thing will unravel
itself if we give it time. It will only make things
worse for him to go off half-cocked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you mean it may unravel itself?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bellamy is a whole lot better man than folks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
give him credit for being. I expect he won&#8217;t be
hard on you when he knows why you did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why did I do it?&#8221; she asked quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! I know why you did it. Jim Budd told
you what he had heard, and you figured you could
save your father from doing it. You meant to
give the money back, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I can&#8217;t prove that either in court or
to Mr. Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to prove it to me. If you say
so, that&#8217;s enough,&#8221; he said in his unenthusiastic
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not judge and jury, and you&#8217;re certainly
not Mr. Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scrape Arizona with a fine-tooth comb and you
couldn&#8217;t get a jury to convict when it&#8217;s up against
the facts in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this she brightened. &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Flatray.&#8221;
And naïvely she added with a little laugh:
&#8220;Are you ready to put the handcuffs on me yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked with a smile at her outstretched hands.
&#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t stay on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you carry them in sizes to fit all
criminals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to put you on parole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll break it and climb out the window. Then
I&#8217;ll run off with this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She indicated the box of treasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need that wash-stand in my room. I&#8217;m going
to take it up there to-night,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This <i>isn&#8217;t</i> a very good safety deposit vault,&#8221;
she answered, and, nodding a careless good-night,
she walked away in her slow-limbed, graceful
Southern fashion.</p>
<p>She had carried it off to the last without breaking
down, but, once in her own room, the girl&#8217;s face
showed haggard in the moonlight. It was one thing
to jest about it with him; it was another to face the
facts as they stood. She was in the power of her
father&#8217;s enemy, the man whose proffer of friendship
they had rejected with scorn. Her pride cried
out that she could not endure mercy from him even
if he wished to extend it. Surely there must be
some other way out than the humiliation of begging
him not to prosecute. She could see none but one,
and that was infinitely worse. Yet she knew it
would be her father&#8217;s first impulsive instinct to seek
to fight her out of her trouble, the more because it
was through him that it had fallen upon her. At
all hazards she must prevent this.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>A CONVERSATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Not five minutes after Melissy had left the
deputy sheriff, another rider galloped up
the road. Jack, returning from his room,
where he had left the box of gold locked up, waited
on the porch to see who this might be.</p>
<p>The horseman proved to be the man Norris, or
Boone, and in a thoroughly bad temper, as Jack
soon found out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you see anything of &#8217;Lissie Lee?&#8221; he demanded
immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lee has just left me. She has gone to
her room,&#8221; answered Flatray quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I want to see her,&#8221; said the other hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you better postpone it to to-morrow.
She&#8217;s some played out and needs sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to see her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack turned, still all gentleness, and called to Jim
Budd, who was in the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jim! Run upstairs and knock on Miss Melissy&#8217;s
door and tell her Mr. Norris is down here.
Ask if she will see him to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a heap of formality out of this,
Mr. Buttinsky,&#8221; sneered the cowpuncher.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>Jack made no answer, unless it were one to
whistle gently and look out into the night as if
he were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, seh. She doan&#8217; wan&#8217; tuh see him to-night,&#8221;
announced Jim upon his return.</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems to settle it, Mr. Norris,&#8221; said Jack
pleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not by a hell of a sight. I&#8217;ve got something
to say to her, and I&#8217;m going to say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; amended the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your say doesn&#8217;t go here against hers. I
reckon you&#8217;ll wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you could notice it.&#8221; The cowpuncher
took a step forward toward the stairway, but Flatray
was there before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out of the way, you. I don&#8217;t stand for any
butting-in,&#8221; the cowboy blustered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a goat, Norris. She&#8217;s tired, and she
says she don&#8217;t want to see you. That&#8217;s enough,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris leaped back with an oath to draw his gun,
but Jack had the quickest draw in Arizona. The
puncher found himself looking into the business
end of a revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better change your mind, seh,&#8221; suggested the
officer amiably. &#8220;I take it you&#8217;ve been drinking
and you&#8217;re some excited. If you were in condition
to <i>savez</i> the situation, you&#8217;d understand that the
young lady doesn&#8217;t care to see you now. Do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
need a church to fall on you before you can take
a hint?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon if you knew all about her, you wouldn&#8217;t
be so anxious to stand up for her,&#8221; Norris said
darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expect we cayn&#8217;t any of us stand the great
white light on all our acts; but if any one can, it&#8217;s
that little girl upstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you say if I told you that she&#8217;s
liable to go to Yuma if I lift my hand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say I was from Missouri and needed
showing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put up that gun, come outside with me, and if
I take a notion I&#8217;ll show you all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack laughed as his gun disappeared. &#8220;I&#8217;d be
willing to bet high that there are a good many citizens
around here haided straighter for Yuma than
Miss Melissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without answering, Norris led the way out and
stopped only when his arm rested on the fence of
the corral.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody can hear us now,&#8221; he said brusquely,
and the ranger got a whiff of his hot whisky breath.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve put it up to me to make good. All right,
I&#8217;ll do it. That little girl in there, as you call
her, is the bad man who held up the Fort Allison
stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officer laughed tolerantly as he lit a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you say it, Norris.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect you to believe it right away, but
it&#8217;s a fact just the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatray climbed to the fence and rested his feet
on a rail. &#8220;Fire ahead. I&#8217;m listenin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first men on the ground after that hold-up
were me and Lee. We covered the situation
thorough and got hold of some points right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right funny too. When I asked you if
you&#8217;d been down there you both denied it,&#8221; commented
the officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were protecting the girl. Mind you, we
didn&#8217;t know who had done it then, but we had reasons
to think the person had just come from this
ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What reasons?&#8221; briefly demanded Flatray.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to go into them. We had them,
anyhow. Then I lit on a foot-print right on the
edge of the ditch that no man ever made. We
didn&#8217;t know what to make of it, but we wiped it
out and followed the ditch, one on each side. We&#8217;d
figured that was the way he had gone. You see,
though water was running in the ditch now, it
hadn&#8217;t been half an hour before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wasn&#8217;t a sign of anybody leaving the
ditch till we got to the ranch; then we saw tracks
going straight to the house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got a bunch of sheep and drove them
down there to muss things up some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris looked sharply at him. &#8220;You got there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
while we were driving them back. Well, that&#8217;s
right. We had to help her out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re helping her out now, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; Jack
asked dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business. I&#8217;ve got my own reasons,
Mr. Deputy. All you got to do is arrest her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as soon as you give me the evidence, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I given it to you? She was seen to
drive away from the house in her rig. She left footprints
down there. She came back up the ditch and
then rode right up to the head-gates and turned on
the water. Jim Little saw her cutting across country
from the head-gates hell-to-split.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far as I can make out, all the evidence you&#8217;ve
given me ain&#8217;t against her, but against you. She
was out drivin&#8217; when it happened, you say, and you
expect me to arrest her for it. It ain&#8217;t against the
law to go driving, seh. And as for that ditch fairy
tale, on your own say-so you wiped out all chance
to prove the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you won&#8217;t arrest her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll furnish the evidence, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you we know she did it. Her father
knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it worryin&#8217; his conscience? Did he ask you
to lay an information against her?&#8221; asked the officer
sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Here&#8217;s the point.&#8221; Not by the
faintest motion of the body had the officer&#8217;s indolence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
been lifted, but the quiet ring of his voice
showed it was gone. &#8220;You and Lee were overheard
planning that robbery the day after you were seen
hanging around the &#8217;Monte Cristo.&#8217; You started
out to hold up the stage. It was held up. By your
own story you were the first men on the ground
after the robbery. I tracked you straight from
there here along the ditch. I found a black mask
in Lee&#8217;s coat. A dozen people saw you on that
fool sheep-drive of yours. And to sum up, I found
the stolen gold right here where you must have
hidden it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You found the gold? Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t the point either, seh. The point is
that I&#8217;ve got you where I want you, Mr. Norris,
alias Mr. Boone. You&#8217;re wound up in a net you
cayn&#8217;t get away from. You&#8217;re wanted back East,
and you&#8217;re wanted here. I&#8217;m onto your little game,
sir. Think I don&#8217;t know you&#8217;ve been trying to
manufacture evidence against me as a rustler?
Think I ain&#8217;t wise to your whole record? You&#8217;re
arrested for robbing the Fort Allison stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norris, standing close in front of him, shot his
right hand out and knocked the officer backward
from the fence. Before the latter could get on his
feet again the cowpuncher was scudding through
the night. He reached his horse, flung himself on,
and galloped away. Harmlessly a bullet or two
zipped after him as he disappeared.</p>
<p>The deputy climbed over the fence again and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
laughed softly to himself. &#8220;You did that right
well, Jack. He&#8217;ll always think he did that by his
lone, never will know you was a partner in that
escape. It&#8217;s a fact, though, I could have railroaded
him through on the evidence, but not without including
the old man. No, there wasn&#8217;t any way
for it but that grandstand escape of Mr. Boone&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still smiling, he dusted himself, put up his revolver,
and returned to the house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE TENDERFOOT MAKES A PROPOSITION</h3>
</div>

<p>Melissy waited in dread expectancy to see
what would happen. Of quick, warm
sympathies, always ready to bear with
courage her own and others&#8217; burdens, she had none
of that passive endurance which age and experience
bring. She was keyed to the heroism of an occasion,
but not yet to that which life lays as a daily
burden upon many without dramatic emphasis.</p>
<p>All next day nothing took place. On the succeeding
one her father returned with the news that
the &#8220;Monte Cristo&#8221; contest had been continued to
another term of court. Otherwise nothing unusual
occurred. It was after mail time that she stepped
to the porch for a breath of fresh air and noticed
that the reward placard had been taken down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did that?&#8221; she asked of Alan McKinstra,
who was sitting on the steps, reading a newspaper
and munching an apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack Flatray took it down. He said the offer
of a reward had been withdrawn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did he do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About an hour ago. Just before he rode off.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Rode off! Where did he go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heard him say he was going to Mesa. He told
your father that when he settled the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone for good, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way I took it. Say, Melissy, Farnum
says Jack told him the gold had been found and
turned back to Morse. Is that right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it looks blamed funny they could get the
bullion back without getting the hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe they&#8217;ll get him yet,&#8221; she consoled him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could get a crack at him,&#8221; the boy
murmured vengefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had one chance at him, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;José spoiled it. Honest, I wasn&#8217;t going to lie
down, &#8217;Lissie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the days followed each other uneventfully.
Bellamy himself never came for his mail now, but
sent one of the boys from the mine for it. Melissy
wondered whether he despised her so much he did
not ever want to see her again. Somehow she did
not like to think this. Perhaps it might be delicacy
on his part. He was going to drop the whole thing
magnanimously and did not want to put upon her
the obligation of thanking him by presenting himself
to her eyes.</p>
<p>But though he never appeared in person, he had
never been so much in her mind. She could not rid
herself of a growing sympathy and admiration for
this man who was holding his own against many.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
A story which was being whispered about reached
her ears and increased this. A bunch of his sheep
had been found poisoned on their feeding ground,
and certain cattle interests were suspected of having
done the dastardly thing.</p>
<p>When she could stand the silence no longer Melissy
called up Jack Flatray on the telephone at
Mesa.</p>
<p>&#8220;You caught me just in time. I&#8217;m leaving for
Phoenix to-night,&#8221; he told her. &#8220;What can I do
for you, Miss Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know what&#8217;s being done about that
Fort Allison stage hold-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The money has been recovered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, but&mdash;what about the&mdash;the criminals?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They made their getaway all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you looking for them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Mr. Morse want you to drop it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was very urgent about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know who the criminals are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t going to prosecute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Mr. Morse say when you made your
report?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Said, &#8216;Thank you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, but&mdash;you know what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not being a mind-reader&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;About the suspect. Did he say anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Said he had private reasons for not pushing the
case. I didn&#8217;t ask him what they were.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was all she could get out of him. It was
less than she had hoped. Still, it was something.
She knew definitely what Bellamy had done.
Wherefore she sat down to write him a note of
thanks. It took her an hour and eight sheets of
paper before she could complete it to her satisfaction.
Even then the result was not what she wanted.
She wished she knew how he felt about it, so that
she could temper it to the right degree of warmth
or coolness. Since she did not know, she erred
on the side of stiffness and made her message
formal.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<div class='la'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Mr. Thomas L. Morse,</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Monte Cristo Mine.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Sir:</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father and I feel that we ought to thank
you for your considerate forbearance in a certain
matter you know of. Believe me, sir,
we are grateful.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Very respectfully,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Melissy Lee.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>She could not, however, keep herself from one
touch of sympathy, and as a postscript she naïvely
added:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about the sheep.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>Before mailing it she carried this letter to her
father. Neither of them had ever referred to the
other about what each knew of the affair of the
robbery. More than once it had been on the tip
of Champ Lee&#8217;s tongue to speak of it, but it was
not in his nature to talk out what he felt, and with
a sigh he had given it up. Now Melissy came
straight to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been writing a letter to Mr. Morse, dad,
thanking him for not having me arrested.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee shot at her a glance of quick alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he know about it, honey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jack Flatray found out the whole thing
and told him. He was very insistent on dropping
it, Mr. Flatray says.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say Jack found out all about it, honey?&#8221;
repeated Lee in surprise.</p>
<p>He was seated in a big chair on the porch, and
she nestled on one arm of it, rumpled his gray hair
as she had always done since she had been a little
girl, kissed him, and plunged into her story.</p>
<p>He heard her to the end without a word, but she
noticed that he gripped the chair hard. When she
had finished he swept her into his arms and broke
down over her, calling her the pet names of her
childhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Honey-bird ... Dad&#8217;s little honey-bird ...
I&#8217;m that ashamed of myse&#8217;f. &#8217;Twas the whisky
did it, lambie. Long as I live I&#8217;ll nevah touch
it again. I&#8217;ll sweah that befo&#8217; God. All week
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
you been packin&#8217; the troubles I heaped on you, precious,
and afteh you-all saved me from being a
criminal....&#8221;</p>
<p>So he went on, spending his tempestuous love in
endearments and caresses, and so together they
afterward talked it out and agreed to send the letter
she had written.</p>
<p>But Lee was not satisfied with her atonement.
He could not rest to let it go at that, without expressing
his own part in it to Bellamy. Next day
he rode up to the mine, and found its owner in
workman&#8217;s slops just stepping from the cage. If
Bellamy were surprised to see him, no sign of it
reached his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll wait a minute till I get these things
off, I&#8217;ll walk up to the cabin with you, Mr. Lee,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you got my daughter&#8217;s letter,&#8221; said
Lee abruptly as he strode up the mountainside with
his host.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I got it an hour ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I be&#8217;n and studied it out, Mr. Morse. I couldn&#8217;t
let it go at that, and so I reckoned I&#8217;d jog along
up hyer and tell you the whole story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as you please, Mr. Lee. I&#8217;m quite satisfied
as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rancher went on as if he had not heard.
&#8220;&#8217;Course I be&#8217;n holding a grudge at you evah since
you took up this hyer claim. I expect that rankles
with me most of the time, and when I take to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
drinking seems to me that mine still belongs to me.
Well, I heerd tell of that shipment you was making,
and I sets out to git it, for it ce&#8217;tainly did seem to
belong to me. Understand, I wasn&#8217;t drunk, but
had be&#8217;n settin&#8217; pretty steady to the bottle for several
days. Melissy finds it out, no matter how, and
undertakes to keep me out of trouble. She&#8217;s that
full of sand, she nevah once thought of the danger
or the consequences. Anyhow, she meant to git the
bullion back to you afteh the thing had blown over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t doubted that a moment since I knew
she did it,&#8221; said Bellamy quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it. I be&#8217;n misjudgin&#8217; you, seh,
but you&#8217;re a white man afteh all. Well, you know
the rest of the story: how she held up the stage,
how Jack drapped in befo&#8217; our tracks were covered,
how smart he worked the whole thing out, and how
my little gyurl confessed to him to save me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a figure do I make in this? First
off, I act like a durn fool, and she has to step in
to save me. Then I let her tote the worry of it
around while I ride off to Mesa. When Jack runs
me down, she takes the blame again. To finish
up with, she writes you a letter of thanks, jes&#8217; as
if the whole fault was hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old soldier selected a smooth rock and
splashed it with tobacco juice before he continued
with rising indignation against himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a fine father for a gyurl like that, ain&#8217;t I?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
Up to date I always had an idee I was some sort
of a man, but dad gum it! I cayn&#8217;t see it hyer.
To think of me lettin&#8217; my little gyurl stand the consequences
of my meanness. No, Mr. Morse, that&#8217;s
one too much for Champ Lee. He&#8217;s nevah going to
touch another drop of whisky long as he lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to hear it. That&#8217;s a square amend to make,
one she will appreciate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I took a <i>pasear</i> up hyer to explain this, and
to thank you for yore kindness. Fac&#8217; is, Mr.
Morse, it would have jest about killed me if anything
had happened to my little &#8217;Lissie. I want to
say that if you had a-be&#8217;n her brother you couldn&#8217;t
&#8217;a&#8217; be&#8217;n more decent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing else to do. It happens that
I am in her debt. She saved my life once. Besides,
I understood the motives for her action when she
broke the law, and I honored them with all my
heart. Flatray felt just as I did about it. So
would any right-thinking man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you cayn&#8217;t keep me from sayin&#8217; again
that you&#8217;re a white man, seh,&#8221; the other said with
a laugh behind which the emotion of tears lay
near.</p>
<p>&#8220;That offer of a compromise is still open, Mr.
Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Southerner shook his grizzled head. &#8220;No, I
reckon not, Mr. Morse. Understand, I got nothin&#8217;
against you. The feud is wiped out, and I&#8217;ll make
you no mo&#8217; trouble. But it&#8217;s yore mine, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
don&#8217;t feel like taking charity. I got enough anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be charity. I&#8217;ve always felt as if
you had a moral claim on an interest in the &#8216;Monte
Cristo.&#8217; If you won&#8217;t take this yourself, why not
let me make out the papers to Miss Lee? You
would feel then that she was comfortably fixed, no
matter what happened to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll lay it befo&#8217; her. Anyhow, we&#8217;re
much obliged to you, Mr. Morse. I&#8217;ll tell you
what, seh,&#8221; he added as an after-thought. &#8220;You
come down and talk it over with &#8217;Lissie. If you
can make her see it that way, good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Champ Lee turned his bronco&#8217;s head homeward
he was more at peace with the world than he
had been for a long time. He felt that he would
be able to look his little girl in the face again. For
the first time in a week he felt at one with creation.
He rode into the ranch plaza humming &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the day following that of Lee&#8217;s call, the mine-owner
saddled his mare and took the trail to the
half-way house. It was not until after the stage
had come and gone that he found the chance for a
word with Melissy alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father submitted my proposition, did he?&#8221;
Bellamy said by way of introducing the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a walk on it. I haven&#8217;t been out of
the house to-day,&#8221; she answered with the boyish
downrightness sometimes uppermost in her.</p>
<p>Calling Jim, she left him in charge of the store,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
caught up a Mexican sombrero, and led the way
up the trail to a grove of live-oaks perched on a
bluff above. Below them stretched the plain, fold
on fold to the blue horizon edge. Close at hand
clumps of cactus, thickets of mesquit, together with
the huddled adobe buildings of the ranch, made up
the details of a scene possible only in the sunburnt
territory. The palpitating heat quivered above the
hot brown sand. No life stirred in the valley except
a circling buzzard high in the sky, and the
tiny moving speck with its wake of dust each knew
to be the stage that had left the station an hour
before.</p>
<p>Melissy, unconscious of the charming picture she
made, stood upon a rock and looked down on it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she said at last slowly, &#8220;that most
people would think this pretty desolate. But it&#8217;s
a part of me. It&#8217;s all I know.&#8221; She broke off and
smiled at him. &#8220;I had a chance to be civilized.
Dad wanted to send me East to school, but I
couldn&#8217;t leave him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you thinking of going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Denver.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her conception of the East amused him. It
was about as accurate as a New Yorker&#8217;s of the
West.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you didn&#8217;t. It would have spoiled you
and sent you back just like every other young lady
the schools grind out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>She turned curiously toward him. &#8220;Am I not
like other girls?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was on his tongue tip to tell her that she was
gloriously different from most girls he had known,
but discretion sealed his lips. Instead, he told her
of life in the city and what it means to society
women, its emptiness and unsatisfaction.</p>
<p>His condemnation was not proof positive to her.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go there for myself some time and see.
And anyhow it must be nice to have all the money
you want with which to travel,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>This gave him his opening. &#8220;It makes one independent.
I think that&#8217;s the best thing wealth
can give&mdash;a sort of spaciousness.&#8221; He waited
perceptibly before he added: &#8220;I hope you have
decided to be my partner in the mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve decided not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your mine. It isn&#8217;t ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nonsense. I always in my heart, recognized
a moral claim you have. Besides, the case
isn&#8217;t finished yet. Perhaps your father may win
his contest. I&#8217;m all for settling out of court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know we won&#8217;t win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him applause from her dark eyes.
&#8220;That&#8217;s very fair of you, but Dad and I can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you still have a grudge at me,&#8221; he smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the least little bit of a one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t take no for an answer, then. I&#8217;ll order
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the papers made out whether you want me to or
not.&#8221; Without giving her a chance to speak, he
passed to another topic: &#8220;I&#8217;ve decided to go out
of the sheep business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those aren&#8217;t my feelings,&#8221; he answered ruefully.
&#8220;I hate to quit under fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do, but your friends will know
why you do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do I do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you know it&#8217;s right. The cattlemen
had the range first. Their living is tied up in cattle,
and your sheep are ruining the feed for them.
Yesterday when I was out riding I counted the
bones of eight dead cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded gravely. &#8220;Yes, in this country sheep
are death to cows. I hate to be a quitter, but I
hate worse to take the bread out of the mouths of a
dozen families. Two days ago I had an offer for
my whole bunch, and to-morrow I&#8217;m going to take
the first instalment over the pass and drive them
down to the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to cross the dead line to get
over the pass,&#8221; she said quickly; for all Cattleland
knew that a guard had been watching his herds to
see they did not cross the pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m going to send Alan with a letter to
Farnum. I don&#8217;t think there will be any opposition
to my crossing it when my object is understood,&#8221;
he smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>Melissy watched him ride away, strong and rugged
and ungraceful, from the head to the heel of
him a man. Life had gone hard with him. She
wondered whether that were the reason her heart
went out to him so warmly.</p>
<p>As she moved about her work that day and the
next little snatches of song broke from her, bubbling
forth like laughter, born of the quiet happiness
within, for which she could give no reason.</p>
<p>After the stage had gone she saddled her pony
and rode toward the head of the pass. In an hour
or two now the sheep would be pouring across the
divide, and she wanted to get a photograph of
them as they emerged from the pass. She was following
an old cattle trail which ran into the main
path just this side of the pass, and she was close
to the junction when the sound of voices stopped
her. Some instinct made her wait and listen.</p>
<p>The speakers were in a dip of the trail just ahead
of her, and the voice of the first she recognized as
belonging to the man Boone. The tone of it was
jubilantly cruel.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir. You don&#8217;t move a step of the way,
not a step, Mr. Alan McKinstra. I&#8217;ve got him
right where I want him, and I don&#8217;t care if you
talk till the cows come home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alan&#8217;s voice rang out indignantly, &#8220;It&#8217;s murder
then&mdash;just plain, low-down murder. If you hold
me here and let Morse fall into a death trap without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
warning him, you&#8217;re as responsible as if you
shot him yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Suits me down to the ground. We&#8217;ll
let it go at that. I&#8217;m responsible. If you want
the truth flat and plain, I don&#8217;t mind telling you
that I wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied if I wasn&#8217;t responsible.
I&#8217;m evening up some little things with Mr. Morse
to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy needed to hear no more to understand
the situation, but if she had, the next words of
Boone would have cleared it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I met up with you and happened on the
news that you was taking a message to Farnum,
and when I got onto the fact that Morse, as you
call him, was moving his sheep across the dead
line, <i>relying on you having got his letter to the
cattlemen to make it safe</i>, it seemed luck too good
to be true. All I had to do was to persuade you
to stay right here with me, and Mr. Morse would
walk into the pass and be wiped out. You get the
beauty of it, my friend, don&#8217;t you? <i>I&#8217;m</i> responsible,
but it will be Farnum and his friends that will
bear the blame. There ain&#8217;t but one flaw in the
whole thing: Morse will never know that it&#8217;s me
that killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You devil!&#8221; cried the boy, with impotent passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve waited ten years for this day, and it&#8217;s come
at last. Don&#8217;t you think for a moment I&#8217;m going
to weaken. No, sir! You&#8217;ll sit there with my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
gun poked in your face just as you&#8217;ve sat for six
hours. It&#8217;s my say-so to-day, sir,&#8221; Boone retorted,
malevolence riding triumph in his voice.</p>
<p>Melissy&#8217;s first impulse was to confront the man,
her next to slip away without being discovered and
then give the alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; continued the cowpuncher; &#8220;I scored
on Mr. Morse two or three nights ago, when I
played hell with one of his sheep camps, and to-day
I finish up with him. His sheep have been
watched for weeks, and at the first move it&#8217;s all up
with him and them. Farnum&#8217;s vaqueros will pay
my debt in full. Just as soon as I&#8217;m right sure
of it I&#8217;ll be jogging along to Dead Man&#8217;s Cache,
and you can go order the coffin for your boss.&#8221;</p>
<p>The venom of the man was something to wonder
at. It filled the listening girl with sick apprehension.
She had not known that such hatred could
live in the world.</p>
<p>Quietly she led her pony back, mounted, and
made a wide detour until she struck the trail above.
Already she could hear the distant bleat of sheep
which told her that the herd was entering the pass.
Recklessly she urged her pony forward, galloping
into the saddle between the peaks without regard to
the roughness of the boulder-strewn path. A voice
from above hailed her with a startled shout as she
flew past. Again, a shot rang out, the bullet whistling
close to her ear. But nothing could stop her
till she reached the man she meant to save.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>And so it happened that Richard Bellamy, walking
at the head of his herd, saw a horse gallop
wildly round a bend almost into his bleating flock.
The rider dragged the bronco to a halt and slipped
to the ground. She stood there ashen-hued, clinging
to the saddle-horn and swaying slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in time.... Thank God!...
Thank God!&#8221; her parched lips murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Lee! You here?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, the man and the girl,
while the wild fear in her heart began to still. The
dust of the drive was thick on his boots, his clothes,
his face, but the soil of travel could not obscure
the power of his carriage, the strong lines of his
shoulders, the set of his broad, flat back, any more
than it could tarnish her rarity, the sweetness of
blood in her that under his gaze beat faintly into
her dusky cheeks. The still force of him somehow
carried reassurance to her. Such virility of manhood
could not be marked for extinction.</p>
<p>She panted out her story, and his eyes never
left her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have risked your life to save mine and
my herders,&#8221; he said very quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go back,&#8221; she replied irrelevantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. The entrance is guarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>This startled her. &#8220;Then&mdash;what shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must ride forward at once. Tell the vaqueros
that I am moving my sheep only to take
them to the railroad. Explain to them how Alan is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
detained with the message I sent Farnum. In a
few minutes we shall follow with the sheep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if they don&#8217;t believe that you are going
out of the sheep business&mdash;what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to take my chance of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed about to speak, but changed her mind,
nodded, swung to the saddle, and rode forward.
After a few minutes Bellamy followed slowly. He
was unarmed, not having doubted that his letter
to the cattleman would make his journey safe.
That he should have waited for an answer was now
plain, but the contract called for an immediate delivery
of the sheep, as he had carefully explained
in his note to Farnum.</p>
<p>Presently he heard again the clatter of a horse&#8217;s
hoofs in the loose shale and saw Melissy returning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he asked as she drew up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told them. I think they believe me, but
I&#8217;m going through the gorge with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up quickly to protest, but did not.
He knew that her thought was that her presence
beside him would protect him from attack. The
rough chivalry of Arizona takes its hat off to a
woman, and Melissy Lee was a favorite of the
whole countryside.</p>
<p>So together they passed into the gulch, Bellamy
walking by the side of her horse. Neither of them
spoke. At their heels was the soft rustle of many
thousands of padding feet.</p>
<p>Once there came to them the sound of cheering,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
and they looked up to see a group of vaqueros waving
their hats and shouting down. Melissy shook
her handkerchief and laughed happily at them. It
was a day to be remembered by these riders.</p>
<p>They emerged into a roll of hill-tops upon which
the setting sun had cast a weird afterglow of radiance
in which the whole world burned. The cactus,
the stunted shrubbery, the painted rocks, seemed
all afire with some magic light that had touched
their commonness to a new wonder.</p>
<p>A sound came to them from below. A man,
rifle in hand and leading a horse, was stealthily
crossing the trail to disappear among the large
boulders beyond.</p>
<p>Melissy did not speak, scarce dared to draw
breath, for the man beneath them was Boone.
There was something furtive and lupine about him
that suggested the wild beast stalking its kill. No
doubt he had become impatient to see the end of
his foe and had ridden forward. He had almost
crossed the path before he looked up and caught
sight of them standing together in the fireglow of
the sunset.</p>
<p>Abruptly he came to a standstill.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God! you slipped through, did you?&#8221; he
said in a low voice of concentrated bitterness.</p>
<p>Bellamy did not answer, but he separated himself
from the girl by a step or two. He knew quite
well what was coming, and he looked down quietly
with steady eyes upon his foe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>From far below there came the faint sound of a
horse breaking its way through brush. Boone
paused to listen, but his eye never wandered from
the bareheaded, motionless figure silhouetted against
the skyline in the ruddy evening glow. He had
shifted his rifle so that it lay in both hands, ready
for immediate action.</p>
<p>Melissy, horror-stricken, had sat silent, but now
she found her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is unarmed!&#8221; she cried to the cowpuncher.</p>
<p>He made no answer. Another sound in the
brush, close at hand, was distracting his attention,
though not his gaze.</p>
<p>Just as he whipped up his rifle Melissy sprang
forward. She heard the sound of the explosion fill
the draw, saw Bellamy clutch at the air and slowly
sink to the ground. Before the echoes had died
away she had flung herself toward the inert body.</p>
<p>The outlaw took a step or two forward, as if to
make sure of his work, but at the sound of running
footsteps he changed his mind, swung to the saddle
and disappeared among the rocks.</p>
<p>An instant later Bob Farnum burst into view.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he demanded.</p>
<p>Melissy looked up. Her face was perfectly ashen.
&#8220;Phil Norris ... he shot Mr. Morse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farnum stepped forward. &#8220;Hurt badly, Mr.
Morse?&#8221;</p>
<p>The wounded man grinned faintly. &#8220;Scared
worse, I reckon. He got me in the fleshy part of
the left arm.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>OLD ACQUAINTANCES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You wanted to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice had the soft, slow intonation
of the South, and it held some quality that
haunted the memory. Or so Melissy thought afterward,
but that may have been because of its owner&#8217;s
appeal to sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are Miss Yarnell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ferne Yarnell is my name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Bellamy asked me to call on you. He
sent this letter of introduction.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint wave of color beat into the cheek of the
stranger. &#8220;You know Mr. Bellamy then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He would have been here to meet you,
but he met with an accident yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An accident!&#8221; There was a quick flash of
alarm in the lifted face.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me to tell you that it was not serious.
He was shot in the arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shot. By whom?&#8221; She was ashen to the
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;By a man called Duncan Boone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know him. He is a dangerous man.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Melissy nodded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we know
how very dangerous he is. We have all been deceived
in him till recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he live here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The strange thing is that he and Mr.
Bellamy had never met in this country until a few
days ago. There used to be some kind of a feud
between the families. But you must know more
about that than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. My family is involved in the feud. Mr.
Bellamy is a distant cousin of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So he told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you known him long?&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy thought that there was a little more than
curiosity in the quick look the young woman flung
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met him when he first came here. He was
lost on the desert and I found him. After that
we became very unfriendly. He jumped a mining
claim belonging to my father. But we&#8217;ve made it
up and agreed to be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wrote about the young lady who saved his
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy smiled. &#8220;Did he say that I was a cattle
and a stage rustler?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said nothing that was not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to him,&#8221; the Western girl
answered breezily. &#8220;And now do tell me, Miss
Yarnell, that you and your people have made up
your mind to stay permanently.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father is still looking the ground over. He
has almost decided to buy a store here. Yet he
has been in the town only a day. So you see he
must like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Outside the open second story window of the
hotel Melissy heard a voice that sounded familiar.
She moved toward the window alcove, and at the
same time a quick step was heard in the hall. Someone
opened the door of the parlor and stood on the
threshold. It was the man called Boone.</p>
<p>Melissy, from the window, glanced round. Her
first impulse was to speak; her second to remain
silent. For the Arkansan was not looking at her.
His mocking ribald gaze was upon Ferne Yarnell.</p>
<p>That young woman looked up from the letter of
introduction she was reading and a startled expression
swept into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dunc Boone,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>The man doffed his hat with elaborate politeness.
&#8220;Right glad to meet up with you again, Miss Ferne.
You was in short dresses when I saw you last.
My, but you&#8217;ve grown pretty. Was it because you
heard I was in Arizona that you came here?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose, rejecting in every line of her erect
figure his impudent geniality, his insolent pretense
of friendliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother is in the hotel. If he learns you
are here there will be trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wicked malice lay in his smiling eyes. &#8220;Trouble
for him or for me?&#8221; he inquired silkily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>His lash flicked her on the raw. Hal Yarnell was
a boy of nineteen. This man had a long record as
a gunfighter to prove him a desperate man. Moreover,
he knew how hopelessly heart sick she was of
the feud that for many years had taken its toll of
blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you done us enough harm, you and
yours? Go away. Leave us alone. That&#8217;s all
I ask of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came in and closed the door. &#8220;But you see
it ain&#8217;t all I ask of you, Ferne Yarnell. I always
did ask all I could get of a girl as pretty as you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you leave me, sir?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon not,&#8221; he drawled between half
shuttered eyes.</p>
<p>She moved toward the door, but he was there
before her. With a turn of his wrist he had
locked it.</p>
<p>&#8220;This interview quits at my say-so, honey.
Think after so many years of absence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder
you&#8217;re going to trample over me
like I was a kid? Guess again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unlock that door,&#8221; she ordered.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get good and ready. We&#8217;ll have our
talk out first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes blazed. She was white as paper though
she faced him steadily. But her heart wavered.
She dared not call out for fear her brother might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
hear and come to her assistance. This she must
forestall at all costs.</p>
<p>A heel clicked in the alcove. For the first time
Norris, or Boone as the Southern girl had called
him, became aware of a third party in the room.
Melissy was leaning out of the window. She called
down to a man standing on the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, come up here quick. I want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boone took a step forward. &#8220;You here, &#8217;Lissie
Lee?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m here. An
unexpected pleasure, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know Ferne Yarnell?&#8221; he asked, for
once taken aback.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as if I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>His quick furtive eye fell upon an envelope on
the floor. He picked it up. Upon it was written,
&#8220;Miss Ferne Yarnell,&#8221; and in the corner, &#8220;Introducing
Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>A muscle twitched in his face. When he looked
up there was an expression of devilish malignity
on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Bellamy&#8217;s handwriting, looks like.&#8221; He
turned to the Arizona girl. &#8220;Then I didn&#8217;t put the
fellow out of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you coward.&#8221;</p>
<p>The angry color crept to the roots of his hair.
&#8220;Better luck next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door knob rattled. Someone outside was
trying to get in. Those inside the room paid no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
obvious attention to him. The venomous face of
the cattle detective held the women fascinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Dick Bellamy ambushed Shep he made
a hell of a bad play of it. My old mammy used
to say that the Boones were born wolves. I can
see where she was right. The man that killed my
brother gets his one of these days and don&#8217;t you
forget it. You just stick around. We&#8217;re due to
shoot this thing out, him and me,&#8221; the man continued,
his deep-socketed eyes burning from the
grim handsome face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open the door,&#8221; ordered a voice from the hall,
shaking the knob violently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know he killed your brother. Someone
else may have done it. And it may have been
done in self defence,&#8221; the Arkansas girl said to
Boone in a voice so low and reluctant that it appeared
the words were wrung from her by torture.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;m a buzzard head? Why for did he
run away? Why did he jump for the sandhills
soon as the word came to arrest him?&#8221; He
snapped together his straight, thin-lipped mouth,
much as a trap closes on its prey.</p>
<p>A heavy weight hurtled against the door and
shook it to the hinges. Melissy had been edging
to the right. Now with a twist of her lissom body
she had slipped past the furious man and turned
the key.</p>
<p>Jack Flatray came into the room. His glance
swept the young women and fastened on the man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
In the crossed eyes of the two was the thrust of
rapiers, the grinding of steel on steel, that deadly
searching for weakness in the other that duelists
employ.</p>
<p>The deputy spoke in a low soft drawl. &#8220;Mornin&#8217;,
Boone. Holding an executive session, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The lids of the detective narrowed to slits. From
the first there had been no pretense of friendship
between these two. There are men who have only
to look once at each other to know they will be
foes. It had been that way with them. Causes of
antagonism had arisen quickly enough. Both dominant
personalities, they had waged silent unspoken
warfare for the leadership of the range. Later
over the favor of Melissy Lee this had grown more
intense, still without having ever been put into
words. Now they were face to face, masks off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yes, until you butted in, Mr. Sheriff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t my busy day. I thought I&#8217;d just drop
in to the meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mistake. We&#8217;re not holding
a cattle rustlers&#8217; convention.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are so many ladies present I can&#8217;t hear
you, but maybe if you said it outside I could,&#8221; the
deputy suggested gently, a gleam of steely anger in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it anywhere to oblige a friend,&#8221; sneered
Boone.</p>
<p>From the moment of meeting neither man had
lowered his gaze by the fraction of an inch. Red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
tragedy was in the air. Melissy knew it. The girl
from Arkansas guessed as much. Yet neither of
them knew how to avert the calamity that appeared
impending. One factor alone saved the situation
for the moment. Flatray had not yet heard of the
shooting of Bellamy. Had he known he would
have arrested Boone on the spot and the latter
would have drawn and fought it out.</p>
<p>Into the room sauntered Lee. &#8220;Hello, &#8217;Lissie.
Been looking for you an hour, honey. Mornin&#8217;,
Norris. Howdy, Jack! Dad burn yore ornery hide,
I ain&#8217;t see you long enough for a good talk in a
coon&#8217;s age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy seized on her father joyfully as an interposition
of Providence. &#8220;Father, this is Miss
Yarnell, the young lady I told you about.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranchman buried her little hand in his big
paw. &#8220;Right glad to meet up with you, Miss
Yarnell. How do you like Arizona by this time?
I reckon Melissy has introduced you to her friends.
No? Make you acquainted with Mr. Flatray.
Shake hands with Mr. Norris, Miss Yarnell.
Where are you, Norris?&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the Bar Double G swung round,
to discover for the first time that harmony was not
present. Boone stood back with a sullen vindictive
expression on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s up, boys?&#8221; the rancher asked, his
glance passing from one to another.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t in this, Lee,&#8221; Boone informed him.
Then, to Flatray: &#8220;See you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy nodded carelessly. &#8220;Any time you
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lank old Confederate took a step forward
to call Boone back, but Melissy caught him by the
sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him go,&#8221; she whispered emphatically.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my boss,&#8221; returned Lee with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re quite through with me, Miss Lee, I&#8217;ll
not intrude longer,&#8221; Flatray said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not,&#8221; spoke Melissy quickly.</p>
<p>She did not intend to let him get away to settle
his quarrel with Boone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rather busy,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your business will have to wait,&#8221; she came
back decisively.</p>
<p>Lee laughed and clapped Jack on the shoulder.
&#8220;Might as well know your boss too, boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy flushed with a flash of temper. &#8220;I&#8217;m
nothing of the kind, dad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! A joke&#8217;s a joke, girl. That&#8217;s twice hand-runnin&#8217;
I get a call-down. You&#8217;re mighty high-heeled
to-day, &#8217;pears like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack smiled grimly. He understood some things
that were hidden from Lee.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING THE BOONE-BELLAMY-YARNELL FEUD</h3>
</div>

<p>The story that Ferne Yarnell told them in
the parlor of the hotel had its beginnings
far back in the days before the great war.
They had been neighbors, these three families, had
settled side by side in this new land of Arkansas,
had hunted and feasted together in amity. In an
hour had arisen the rift between them that was to
widen to a chasm into which much blood had since
been spilt. It began with a quarrel between hotheaded
young men. Forty years later it was still
running its blind wasteful course.</p>
<p>Even before the war the Boones had begun to
go down hill rapidly. Cad Boone, dissipated and
unprincipled, had found even the lax discipline of
the Confederate army too rigid and had joined the
guerrillas, that band of hangers-on which respected
neither flag and developed a cruelty that was appalling.
Falling into the hands of Captain Ransom
Yarnell, he had been tried by drumhead courtmartial
and executed within twenty four hours of his
capture.</p>
<p>The boast of the Boones was that they never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
forgot an injury. They might wait many years for
the chance, but in the end they paid their debts.
Twenty years after the war Sugden Boone shot
down Colonel Yarnell as he was hitching his horse
in front of the courthouse at Nemo. Next Christmas
eve a brother of the murdered man&mdash;Captain
Tom, as his old troopers still called him&mdash;met old
Sugden in the postoffice and a revolver duel followed.
From it Captain Tom emerged with a
bullet in his arm. Sugden was carried out of the
store feet first to a house of mourning.</p>
<p>The Boones took their time. Another decade
passed. Old Richard Bellamy, father of the young
man, was shot through the uncurtained window of
his living rooms while reading the paper one night.
Though related to the Yarnells, he had never taken
any part in the feud beyond that of expressing his
opinion freely. The general opinion was that he
had been killed by Dunc Boone, but there was no
conclusive evidence to back it. Three weeks later
another one of the same faction met his fate.
Captain Tom was ambushed while riding from his
plantation to town and left dead on the road. Dunc
Boone had been seen lurking near the spot, and
immediately after the killing he was met by two
hunters as he was slipping through the underbrush
for the swamps. There was no direct evidence
against the young man, but Captain Tom had been
the most popular man in the county. Reckless
though he was, Duncan Boone had been forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
to leave the country by the intensity of the popular
feeling against him.</p>
<p>Again the feud had slumbered. It was understood
that the Yarnells and the Bellamys were ready
to drop it. Only one of the opposite faction remained
on the ground, a twin brother of Duncan.
Shep Boone was a drunken ne&#8217;er-do-well, but since
he now stood alone nothing more than empty
threats was expected of him. He spent his time
idly with a set of gambling loafers, but he lacked the
quality of active malice so pronounced in Dunc.</p>
<p>A small part of the old plantation, heavily mortgaged,
still belonged to Shep and was rented by
him to a tenant, Jess Munro. He announced one
day that he was going to collect the rent due him.
Having been drinking heavily, he was in an abusive
frame of mind. As it chanced he met young Hal
Yarnell, just going into the office of his kinsman
Dick Bellamy, with whom he was about to arrange
the details of a hunting trip they were starting
upon. Shep emptied his spleen on the boy, harking
back to the old feud and threatening vengeance at
their next meeting. The boy was white with rage,
but he shut his teeth and passed upstairs without
saying a word.</p>
<p>The body of Shep Boone was found next day
by Munro among the blackberry bushes at the fence
corner of his own place. No less than four witnesses
had seen young Yarnell pass that way with
a rifle in his hand about the same time that Shep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
was riding out from town. They had heard a shot,
but had thought little of it. Munro had been hoeing
cotton in the field and had seen the lad as he
passed. Later he had heard excited voices, and
presently a shot. Other circumstantial evidence
wound a net around the boy. He was arrested.
Before the coroner held an inquest a new development
startled the community. Dick Bellamy fled
on a night train, leaving a note to the coroner exonerating
Hal. In it he practically admitted the
crime, pleading self defence.</p>
<p>This was the story that Ferne Yarnell told in
the parlor of the Palace Hotel to Jack Flatray and
the Lees.</p>
<p>Melissy spoke first. &#8220;Did Mr. Bellamy kill the
man to keep your brother from being killed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It must have been that. It&#8217;s
all so horrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy&#8217;s eyes gleamed. &#8220;Think of it another
way, Miss Yarnell. Bellamy was up against it.
Your brother is only a boy. He took his place. A
friend couldn&#8217;t have done more for another.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color beat into the face of the Arkansas girl
as she looked at him. &#8220;No. He sacrificed his
career for him. He did a thing he must have hated
to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sure some man,&#8221; Flatray pronounced.</p>
<p>A young man, slight, quick of step, and erect as
a willow sapling, walked into the room. He looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
from one to another with clear level eyes. Miss
Ferne introduced him as her brother.</p>
<p>A thought crossed the mind of the deputy. Perhaps
this boy had killed his enemy after all and
Bellamy had shouldered the blame for him. If the
mine owner were in love with Ferne Yarnell this
was a hypothesis more than possible. In either
case he acquitted the slayer of blame. In his pocket
was a letter from the sheriff at Nemo, Arkansas,
stating that his county was well rid of Shep Boone
and that the universal opinion was that neither
Bellamy nor young Yarnell had been to blame for
the outcome of the difficulty. Unless there came
to him an active demand for the return of Bellamy
he intended to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>
<p>No such demand came. Within a month the
mystery was cleared. The renter Munro delivered
himself to the sheriff at Nemo, admitting that he
had killed Shep Boone in self defence. The dead
man had been drinking and was exceedingly quarrelsome.
He had abused his tenant and at last
drawn on him. Whereupon Munro had shot him
down. At first afraid of what might happen to
him, he had stood aside and let the blame be shouldered
upon young Yarnell. But later his conscience
had forced him to a confession. It is enough here
to say that he was later tried and acquitted, thus
closing the chapter of the wastrel&#8217;s tragic death.</p>
<p>The day after the news of Munro&#8217;s confession
reached Arizona Richard Bellamy called upon Flatray
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
to invite him to his wedding. As soon as his
name was clear he had asked Ferne Yarnell to
marry him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>KIDNAPPED</h3>
</div>

<p>As a lake ripples beneath a summer breeze, so
Mesa was stirred from its usual languor by
the visit of Simon West. For the little
Arizona town was dreaming dreams. Its imagination
had been aroused; and it saw itself no longer
a sleepy cow camp in the unfeatured desert, but a
metropolis, in touch with twentieth-century life.</p>
<p>The great Simon West, pirate of finance, empire
builder, molder of the destinies of the mighty
Southwestern Pacific system, was to touch the adobe
village with his transforming wand and make of
it a hive of industry. Rumors flew thick and fast.</p>
<p>Mesa was to be the junction for the new spur
that would run to the big Lincoln dam. The town
would be a division point; the machine shops of the
system would be located there. Its future, if still
a trifle vague, was potentially immense. Thus, with
cheerful optimism, did local opinion interpret the
visit of the great man.</p>
<p>Whatever Simon West may have thought of
Mesa and its prospects, he kept behind his thin,
close-shut lips. He was a dry, gray little man of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
fifty-five, with sharp, twinkling eyes that saw everything
and told nothing. Certainly he wore none of
the visible signs of greatness, yet at his nod Wall
Street trembled. He had done more to change the
map of industrial America than any other man,
alive or dead. Wherefore, big Beauchamp Lee,
mayor of Mesa, and the citizens on the reception
committee did their very best to impress him with
the future of the country, as they motored out to
the dam.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most promising spot on earth. Beats California
a city block on oranges and citrons. Ever see
an Arizona peach, Mr. West? It skins the world,&#8221;
the big cattleman ran on easily.</p>
<p>The financier&#8217;s eye took in the girl sitting beside
the chauffeur in the front seat, and he nodded assent.</p>
<p>Melissy Lee bloomed. She was vivid as a wild
poppy on the hillsides past which they went flashing.
But she had, too, a daintiness, a delicacy of coloring
and contour, that suggested the fruit named by
her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we raise the best here,&#8221; that simple
gentleman bragged patriotically. &#8220;All we need is
water, and the Lincoln dam assures us of plenty.
Yes, sir! It certainly promises to be an Eden.&#8221;</p>
<p>West unlocked his lips long enough to say:
&#8220;Any country can promise. I&#8217;m looking for one
that will perform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re seeing it right now, seh,&#8221; the mayor assured
him, and launched into fluent statistics.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>West heard, saw the thing stripped of its enthusiasm,
and made no comment either for or against.
He had plenty of imagination, or he could never
have accomplished the things he had done. However,
before any proposition appealed to him he had
to see money in the deal. Whether he saw it in this
particular instance, nobody knew; and only one person
had the courage to ask him point-blank what
his intentions were. This was Melissy.</p>
<p>Luncheon was served in the pleasant filtered sunlight,
almost under the shadow of the great dam.</p>
<p>On the way out Melissy had sat as demure and
dovelike as it was possible for her to be. But now
she showed herself to be another creature.</p>
<p>Two or three young men hovered about her; notable
among them was a young fellow of not many
words, good-humored, strong, with a look of power
about him which the railroad king appreciated.
Jack Flatray they called him. He was the newly-elected
sheriff of the county.</p>
<p>The great man watched the girl without appearing
to do so. He was rather at a loss to account
for the exotic, flamelike beauty into which she had
suddenly sparkled; but he was inclined to attribute
it to the arrival of Flatray.</p>
<p>Melissy sat on a flat rock beside West, swinging
her foot occasionally with the sheer active joy of
life, the while she munched sandwiches and pickles.
The young men bantered her and each other, and
she flashed back retorts which gave them alternately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
deep delight at the discomfiture of some other. Toward
the close of luncheon, she turned her tilted
chin from Flatray, as punishment for some audacity
of his, and beamed upon the railroad magnate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very good of you to notice me at last,&#8221; he
said, with his dry smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was afraid of you,&#8221; she confided cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I so awesome?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your reputation, you know. You&#8217;re quite
a dragon. I&#8217;m told you gobble a new railroad every
morning for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lissie,&#8221; her father warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her alone,&#8221; the great man laughed. &#8220;Miss
Lee is going to give me the privilege of hearing the
truth about myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m asking. I don&#8217;t know what the truth
is,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what you think is the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter what we think about you. The
important thing to know is what you think about
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I to tell you what I think of you&mdash;with all
these young men here?&#8221; he countered.</p>
<p>She was excited by her own impudence. The
pink had spilled over her creamy cheeks. She
flashed a look of pretended disdain at her young
men. Nevertheless, she made laughing protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not me, but Mesa, that counts,&#8221; she
answered ungrammatically. &#8220;Tell me that you&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
going to help us set orchards blossoming in these
deserts, and we&#8217;ll all love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You offer an inducement, Miss Lee. Come&mdash;let
us walk up to the Point and see this wonderful
country of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clapped her hands. &#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s! I&#8217;m tired
of boys, anyhow. They know nothing but nonsense.&#8221;
She made a laughing moue at Flatray, and
turned to join the railroad builder.</p>
<p>The young sheriff arose and trailed to his pony.
&#8220;My marching orders, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>They walked up the hill together, the great man
and the untutored girl. He still carried himself with
the lightness of the spare, wiry man who has never
felt his age. As for her, she moved as one on
springs, her slender, willowy figure beautiful in
motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re loyal to Mesa. Born and brought up
there?&#8221; West asked Melissy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I was brought up on the Bar Double G
ranch. Father sold it not long since. We&#8217;re interested
in the Monte Cristo mine, and it has done
so well that we moved to town,&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>At the first bend in the mountain road Jack had
turned in his saddle to look at her as she climbed
the steep. A quarter of a mile farther up there was
another curve, which swept the trail within sight
of the summit. Here Flatray pulled up and got
out his field glasses. Leisurely the man and the
maid came into sight from the timber on the shoulder
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
of the hill, and topped the last ascent. Jack
could discern Melissy gesturing here and there as
she explained the lay of the land.</p>
<p>Something else caught and held his glasses. Four
riders had emerged from a little gulch of dense
aspens which ran up the Point toward the summit.
One of these had with him a led horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I wonder what that means?&#8221; the sheriff
mused aloud.</p>
<p>He was not left long in doubt. The four men
rode swiftly, straight toward the man and the girl
above. One of them swung from the saddle and
stepped forward. He spoke to West, who appeared
to make urgent protest. The dismounted rider answered.
Melissy began to run. Very faintly there
came to Flatray her startled cry. Simultaneously
he caught the flash of the sun on bright steel. The
leader of the four had drawn a revolver and was
covering West with it. Instantly the girl stopped
running. Plainly the life of the railroad president
had been threatened unless she stopped.</p>
<p>The man behind the weapon swept a gesture in
the direction of the led horse. Reluctantly West
moved toward it, still protesting. He swung to
the saddle, and four of the horses broke into a canter.
Only the man with the drawn revolver remained
on the ground with Melissy. He scabbarded
his gun, took a step or two toward her, and made
explanations. The girl stamped her foot, and half
turned from him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>He laughed, stepped still closer to her, and spoke
again. Melissy, with tilted chin, seemed to be unaware
that he existed. Another step brought him
to her side. Once more he spoke. No stone wall
could have given him less recognition. Then Jack
let out a sudden fierce imprecation, and gave his
pony the spur. For the man had bent forward
swiftly, had kissed the girl on the lips once&mdash;twice&mdash;three
times, had swept his hat off in a low, mocking
bow, and had flung himself on his horse, and
galloped off.</p>
<p>Pebbles and shale went flying from the horse&#8217;s
hoofs as the sheriff tore down the trail toward Melissy.
He cut off at an angle and dashed through
cactus and over rain-washed gullies at breakneck
speed, pounding up the stiff slope to the summit.
He dragged his pony to a halt, and leaped off at
the same instant.</p>
<p>Melissy came to him with flashing eyes. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t you get here sooner?&#8221; she panted, as if she
had been running; for the blind rage was strong
in her.</p>
<p>His anger burst out to meet hers. &#8220;I wish I
had!&#8221; he cried, with a furious oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;He insulted me. He laughed at me, and taunted
me&mdash;and kissed me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack nodded. &#8220;I saw. If I had only had my
rifle with me! Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wore a mask. But I knew him. It was
Dunc Boone.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;With the Roaring Fork gang?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Is he one of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking so for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must have known about our picnic. But
what do they want with Mr. West?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s richest men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he doesn&#8217;t carry his money with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He carries his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They must mean to hold him for a ransom. Is
that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve guessed it. That&#8217;s the play.&#8221; Jack
considered, his eyes on the far-away hills. When
he spoke again it was with sharp decision. &#8220;Hit
the trail back to town with your motor. Don&#8217;t lose
a minute on the way. Send a dispatch to Bucky
O&#8217;Connor. You&#8217;d ought to get him at Douglas.
If not, some of his rangers will know where to reach
him. Keep the wires hot till you&#8217;re in touch with
him. Better sign my name. I&#8217;ve been writing him
about this outfit. This job is cut out for Bucky,
and we&#8217;ve got to get him on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are <i>you</i> going to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do much&mdash;I&#8217;m not armed. First time
I&#8217;ve been caught that way since I&#8217;ve been sheriff.
Came out to-day for a picnic and left my gun at
home. But if they&#8217;re the Roaring Fork outfit,
they&#8217;ll pass through the Elkhorn Cañon, heading
for Dead Man&#8217;s Cache. I&#8217;m going to cut around
Old Baldy and try to beat them to it. Maybe I
can recognize some of them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But if they see you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t aiming to let them see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, they may.&#8221;</p>
<p>His quiet eyes met hers steadily. &#8220;Yes, they
may.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were friends again, though he had never fully
forgiven her doubt of him. It might be on the cards
that some day she would be more to him than a
friend. Understanding perfectly the danger of what
he proposed, she yet made no protest. The man
who would storm her heart must be one who would
go the limit, for her standards were those of the
outdoor West. She, too, was &#8220;game&#8221; to the core;
and she had never liked him better than she did
at this moment. A man must be a man, and take
his fighting chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not for years before had she called him by his
first name. His heart leaped, but he did not let
even his look tell what he was feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll cut right down from here, Melissy.
Better not lose any time getting to town. So-long!&#8221;
And with that he had swung to the saddle and
was off.</p>
<p>Melissy ran swiftly down to the picnic party and
cried out her news. It fell upon them like a bolt
out of a June sky. Some exclaimed and wondered
and deplored; but she was proud to see that her
father took instant command, without an unnecessary
word.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve caught us in swimming, boys! We&#8217;ve
got to burn the wind back to town for our guns.
Dick, you ride around by the Powder Horn and
gather up the boys on the ranch. Get Swain to
swing around to the south and comb the lower
gulches of the Roaring Fork. Tell him to get in
touch with me soon as he can. I&#8217;ll come through
by Elkhorn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee helped his daughter into the machine, and
took his place beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit the high spots, Jim. I&#8217;ve got an engagement
in the hills that won&#8217;t wait, prior to which
I&#8217;ve got to get back to town immediate,&#8221; he told
the chauffeur cheerfully; for he was beginning to
enjoy himself as in the old days, when he had been
the hard-riding sheriff of a border county which
took the premium for bad men.</p>
<p>The motor car leaped forward, fell into its pace,
and began to hum its song of the road as it ate up
swiftly the miles that lay between the dam and
Mesa.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A CAPTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Flatray swung around Old Baldy through
the sparse timber that edged its roots. He
knew this country well; for he had run
cattle here, and combed the draws and ridges on
the annual spring and fall round-ups.</p>
<p>There was no trail to follow. Often the lay of
the land forced him to a detour; for it was rough
with washes, with matted cactus, and with a thick
growth of netted mesquite and underbrush. But
true as the needle of a compass, he turned back
always to the direction he was following. He had
the instinct for direction, sharpened almost to infallibility
by the experience his work had given him.</p>
<p>So, hour after hour, he swung forward, pushing
his horse over the ground in a sort of running walk,
common to the plains. Sunset found him climbing
from the foothills into the mountains beyond.
Starlight came upon him in a saddle between the
peaks, still plodding up by winding paths to the
higher altitudes that make the ridge of the continent&#8217;s
backbone.</p>
<p>The moon was up long before he struck a gulch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
spur that led to Elkhorn Cañon. Whether he would
be in time or not&mdash;assuming that he had guessed
aright as to the destination of the outlaws&mdash;he could
not tell. It would be, at best, a near thing. For,
though he had come more directly, they had followed
a trail which made the going much faster.
Fast as the cow pony could pick its way along the
rock-strewn gulch, he descended, eye and ear alert
to detect the presence of another human being in
this waste of boulders, of moonlit, flickering shadows,
of dark awesome peaks.</p>
<p>His quick ear caught the faintest of sounds. He
slipped from the saddle and stole swiftly forward
to the point where the gulch joined the main cañon.
Voices drifted to him&mdash;the sound of careless laughter,
wafted by the light night wind. He had missed
the outlaws by scarce a hundred yards. There was
nothing for it but to follow cautiously. As he was
turning to go back for his horse the moon emerged
from behind a cloud and flooded the cañon with a
cold, silvery light. It showed Jack a man and a
horse standing scarce twenty yards from him. The
man had his back to him. He had dismounted, and
was tightening the cinches of his saddle.</p>
<p>Flatray experienced a pang of disappointment.
He was unarmed. His second thought sent him
flying noiselessly back to his horse. Deftly he unloosed
the rope which always hung coiled below
the saddle horn. On tiptoe he ran back to the gulch
mouth, bearing to the right, so as to come directly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
opposite the man he wanted. As he ran he arranged
the lariat to his satisfaction, freeing the loop and
making sure that the coil was not bound. Very
cautiously he crept forward, taking advantage for
cover of a boulder which rose from the bed of the
gulch.</p>
<p>The man had finished tightening the girth. His
foot rose to the stirrup. He swung up from the
ground, and his right leg swept across the flank of
the pony. It did not reach the stirrup; for, even
as he rose, Jack&#8217;s lariat snaked forward and dropped
over his head to his breast. It tightened sharply
and dragged him back, pinioning his arms to his
side. Before he could shake one of them free to
reach the revolver in his chaps, he was lying on his
back, with Flatray astride of him. The cattleman&#8217;s
left hand closed tightly upon his windpipe, while the
right searched for and found the weapon in the holster
of the prostrate man.</p>
<p>Not until the steel rim of it pressed against the
teeth of the man beneath him did Jack&#8217;s fingers
loosen. &#8220;Make a sound, and you&#8217;re a dead man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other choked and gurgled. He was not yet
able to cry out, even had he any intention of so
doing. But defiant eyes glared into those of the
man who had unhorsed and captured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are your pals bound for?&#8221; Flatray demanded.</p>
<p>He got no answer in words, but sullen eyes flung
out an obstinate refusal to give away his associates.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;re one of the Roaring Fork outfit,&#8221;
Jack suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know so darn much I&#8217;ll leave you to guess
the rest,&#8221; growled the prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing I&#8217;ll guess is that, if anything
happens to Simon West, you&#8217;ll hang for it, my
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to prove some things first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatray&#8217;s hand slid into the man&#8217;s coat pocket,
and drew forth a piece of black cloth that had been
used as a mask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s exhibit A, to begin with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man on the ground suddenly gave an upward
heave, grasped at the weapon, and let out a yell for
help that echoed back from the cliff, while the cattleman
let the butt of the revolver crash heavily down
upon his face. The heavy gun came down three
times before the struggling outlaw would subside,
and then not before blood streamed from ugly gashes
into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough, damn you!&#8221; the fellow muttered
sullenly. &#8220;What do you want with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go along with me. Let out another sound,
and I&#8217;ll bump you off. Get a move on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack got to his feet and dragged up his prisoner.
The man was a heavy-set, bowlegged fellow of about
forty, hard-faced, and shifty-eyed&mdash;a frontier miscreant,
unless every line of the tough, leathery countenance
told a falsehood. But he had made his experiment
and failed. He knew what manner of man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
his captor was, and he had no mind for another
lesson from him. He slouched to his horse, under
propulsion of the revolver, and led the animal into
the gulch.</p>
<p>Both mounted, Jack keeping the captive covered
every moment of the time; and they began to retrace
the way by which the young cattleman had
just come.</p>
<p>After they had ridden about a quarter of a mile
Flatray made a readjustment of the rope. He let
the loop lie loosely about the neck of the outlaw,
the other end of it being tied to the horn of his own
saddle. Also, he tied the hands of the man in such
a way that, though they were free to handle the
bridle rein, he could not raise them from the saddle
as high as his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you make any sudden moves, you&#8217;ll be committing
suicide. If you yell out, it will amount to
about the same thing. It&#8217;s up to you to be good,
looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man cursed softly. He knew that the least
attempt to escape or to attract the attention of his
confederates would mean his undoing. Something
about this young man&#8217;s cold eye and iron jaw told
him that he would not hesitate to shoot, if necessary.</p>
<p>Voices came to them from the cañon. Flatray
guessed that a reconnaissance of the gulch would
be made, and prepared himself for it by deflecting
his course from the bed of the <i>arroyo</i> at a point
where the walls fell back to form a little valley. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
little grove of aspens covered densely the shoulder
of a hillock some fifty yards back, and here he took
his stand. He dismounted, and made his prisoner
do the same.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; he ordered crisply.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To keep me from blowing the top of your head
off,&#8221; answered Jack quietly.</p>
<p>Without further discussion, the man sat down.
His captor stood behind him, one hand on the shoulder
of his prisoner, his eyes watching the point of
the gulch at which the enemy would appear.</p>
<p>Two mounted men showed presently in silhouette.
Almost opposite the grove they drew up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mighty queer what has become of Hank,&#8221; one
of them said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t reckon there&#8217;s any use
looking any farther. You don&#8217;t figure he&#8217;s aiming
to throw us down&mdash;do you, Buck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. He&#8217;ll stick, Hank will. But it sure looks
darned strange. Here&#8217;s him a-ridin&#8217; along with us,
and suddenly he&#8217;s missin&#8217;. We hear a yell, and go
back to look for him. Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;. You don&#8217;t
allow the devil could have come for him sudden&mdash;do
you, Jeff?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was said with a laugh, defiantly, but none the
less Jack read uneasiness in the manner of the man.
It seemed to him that both were eager to turn back.
Giant boulders, carved to grotesque and ghostly
shapes by a million years&#8217; wind and water, reared
themselves aloft and threw shadows in the moonlight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
The wind, caught in the gulch, rose and fell
in unearthly, sibilant sounds. If ever fiends from
below walk the earth, this time and place was a
fitting one for them. Jack curved a hand around
his mouth, and emitted a strange, mournful, low cry,
which might have been the scream of a lost soul.</p>
<p>Jeff clutched at the arm of his companion. &#8220;Did
you hear that, Buck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what do you reckon it was, Jeff?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again Jack let his cry curdle the night.</p>
<p>The outlaws took counsel of their terror. They
were hardy, desperate men, afraid of nothing mortal
under the sun. But the dormant superstition in them
rose to their throats. Fearfully they wheeled and
gave their horses the spur. Flatray could hear them
crashing through the brush.</p>
<p>He listened while the rapid hoofbeats died away,
until even the echoes fell silent. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be moving,&#8221;
he announced to his prisoner.</p>
<p>For a couple of hours they followed substantially
the same way that Jack had taken, descending gradually
toward the foothills and the plains. The stars
went out, and the moon slid behind banked clouds,
so that the darkness grew with the passing hours.
At length Flatray had to call a halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll camp here till morning,&#8221; he announced
when they reached a grassy park.</p>
<p>The horses were hobbled, and the men sat down
opposite each other in the darkness. Presently the
prisoner relaxed and fell asleep. But there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
sleep for his captor. The cattleman leaned against
the trunk of a cottonwood and smoked his pipe. The
night grew chill, but he dared not light a fire. At
last the first streaks of gray dawn lightened the sky.
A quarter of an hour later he shook his captive from
slumber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to hit the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw murmured sleepily, &#8220;How&#8217;s that,
Dunc? Twenty-five thousand apiece!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wake up! We&#8217;ve got to vamose out of here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the fellow shook the sleep from his brain.
He looked at Flatray sullenly, without answering.
But he climbed into the saddle which Jack had
cinched for him. Dogged and wolfish as he was,
the man knew his master, and was cowed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE TABLES TURNED</h3>
</div>

<p>From the local eastbound a man swung to the
station platform at Mesa. He was a dark,
slim, little man, wiry and supple, with restless
black eyes which pierced one like bullets.</p>
<p>The depot loungers made him a focus of inquiring
looks. But, in spite of his careless ease, a shrewd
observer would have read anxiety in his bearing. It
was as if behind the veil of his indifference there
rested a perpetual vigilance. The wariness of a
beast of prey lay close to the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, gentlemen,&#8221; he drawled, sweeping the
group with his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;,&#8221; responded one of the loafers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume some of you gentlemen can direct me
to the house of Mayor Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The mayor ain&#8217;t to home,&#8221; volunteered a lank,
unshaven native in butternut jeans and boots.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it was his house I inquired for,&#8221; suggested
the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fust house off the square on the yon side of the
postoffice&mdash;a big two-story brick, with a gallery and
po&#8217;ches all round it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>Having thanked his informant, the stranger
passed down the street. The curious saw him pass
in at the mayor&#8217;s gate and knock at the door. It
opened presently, and disclosed a flash of white,
which they knew to be the skirt of a girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that&#8217;s Miss &#8217;Lissie,&#8221; the others were informed
by the unshaven one. &#8220;She&#8217;s let him in and
shet the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inevitably there followed speculation as to who
the arrival might be. That his coming had something
to do with the affair of the West kidnapping,
all were disposed to agree; but just what it might
have to do with it, none of them could do more
than guess. If they could have heard what passed
between Melissy and the stranger, their curiosity
would have been gratified.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good mornin&#8217;, miss. Is Mayor Lee at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;he isn&#8217;t. He hasn&#8217;t got back yet. Is there
anything I can do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Two rows of even white teeth flashed in a smile.
&#8220;I thought maybe there was something I could do
for you. You are Miss Lee, I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I don&#8217;t quite understand&mdash;unless you
have news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no news&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Her eager glance swept over
him. The brown eyes, which had been full of questioning,
flashed to understanding. &#8220;You are not
Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I not?&#8221; he smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I mean&mdash;are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At your service, Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had heard for years of this lieutenant of
rangers, who was the terror of all Arizona &#8220;bad
men.&#8221; Her father, Jack Flatray, the range riders
whom she knew&mdash;game men all&mdash;hailed Bucky
O&#8217;Connor as a wonder. For coolness under fire,
for acumen, for sheer, unflawed nerve, and for his
skill in that deadly game he played of hunting down
desperadoes, they called him chief ungrudgingly.
He was a daredevil, who had taken his life in his
hands a hundred times. Yet always he came through
smiling, and brought back with him the man he
went after. The whisper ran that he bore a charmed
life, so many had been his hairbreadth escapes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; the girl invited. &#8220;Father said, if you
came, I was to keep you here until he got back or
sent a messenger for you. He&#8217;s hunting for the
criminals in the Roaring Fork country. Of course,
he didn&#8217;t know when you would get here. At the
time he left we hadn&#8217;t been able to catch you on the
wire. I signed Mr. Flatray&#8217;s name at his suggestion,
because he was in correspondence with you
once about the Roaring Fork outlaws. He is out
in the hills, too. He started half an hour after the
kidnappers. But he isn&#8217;t armed. I&#8217;m troubled about
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the young man&#8217;s white-toothed smile
flashed. &#8220;You&#8217;d better be. Anybody that goes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
hunting Black MacQueen unarmed ought to be right
well insured.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded, a shadow in her eyes. &#8220;Yes&mdash;but
he would go. He doesn&#8217;t mean them to see him,
if he can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black sees a heap he isn&#8217;t expected to see. He
has got eyes all over the hills, and they see by night
as well as by day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I know he has spies everywhere; and he
has the hill people terrorized, they say. You think
this is his work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big thing&mdash;the kind of job he likes to
tackle. Who else would dare do such a thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what father thinks. If he had stolen the
President of the United States, it wouldn&#8217;t have
stirred up a bigger fuss. Newspaper men and detectives
are hurrying here from all directions. They
are sure to catch him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>She noticed a curious, derisive contempt in the
man&#8217;s voice, and laid it to his vanity. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean
that <i>they</i> are. I mean that <i>you</i> are sure to get him,&#8221;
she hastened to add. &#8220;Father thinks you are wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m much obliged to him,&#8221; said the man, with
almost a sneer.</p>
<p>He seemed to have so good an opinion of himself
that he was above praise even. Melissy was
coming to the decision that she did not like him&mdash;which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
was disappointing, since she had expected to
like him immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t look for you till night. You wired you
would be on number seven,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I understood
that was the earliest you could get here.&#8221;</p>
<p>His explanation of the change was brief, and invited
no further discussion. &#8220;I found I could make
an earlier train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you could. Father says it is always
well to start on the trail while it is fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever seen this MacQueen, Miss Lee?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless he was there when Mr. West was
kidnapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know any of the men?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &#8220;I thought one was Duncan
Boone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the leader, I think, moved the way he
does.&#8221; Her anger flashed for an instant. &#8220;And
acted like him&mdash;detestably.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was he violent to West? Injure him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;he didn&#8217;t do him any physical injury that
I saw. I wasn&#8217;t thinking about Mr. West.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely he didn&#8217;t lay hands on <i>you</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up, in time to see the flicker of amusement
sponged from his face. It stirred vague anger
in her. &#8220;He was insolent and ungentlemanly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As how?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter how.&#8221; Her manner specifically
declined to particularize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you recognize him again if you met
him? Describe him, if you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I used to know him well&mdash;before he became
known as an outlaw,&#8221; she added after a perceptible
hesitation. &#8220;There&#8217;s something ravenous
about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean that he is fierce and bloodthirsty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean that; though, for that matter,
I don&#8217;t think he would stick at anything. What
I mean is that he is pantherine in his movements&mdash;more
lithe and supple than most men are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he a big man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;medium size, and dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were four of them, you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jack saw them, too, but at a distance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He reached you after they were out of sight?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had been gone about five minutes when I
saw him&mdash;five or ten. I couldn&#8217;t be sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boone offered no personal indignity to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you so sure?&#8221; she flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The story is that he is quite the ladies&#8217; man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy laughed scornfully.</p>
<p>At his request, she went over again the story of
the abduction, telling everything save the matter of
the ravished kisses. This she kept to herself. She
did not quite know why, except that there was
something she did not like about this Bucky O&#8217;Connor.
He had a trick of narrowing his eyes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
gloating over her, as a cat gloats over its expected
kill.</p>
<p>However, his confidence impressed her. Cocksure
he was, and before long she knew him boastful; but
competence sat on him, none the less. She thought
she could see why he was held to be the most deadly
bloodhound on a trail that even Arizona could produce.
That he was fearless she did not need to be
told, any more than she needed a certificate that on
occasion he could be merciless. On the other hand,
he fitted very badly with the character of the young
lieutenant of rangers, as Jack Flatray had sketched
it for her. Her friend&#8217;s description of his hero had
been enthusiastic. She decided that the young cattleman
was a bad judge of men&mdash;though, of course,
he had never actually met O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll not wait for your father&#8217;s report,
Miss Lee. I work independent of other men. That
is how I get the wonderful results I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>His conceit nettled her; also, it stung her filial
loyalty. &#8220;My father was the best sheriff this county
ever had,&#8221; she said stiffly.</p>
<p>He smiled satirically. &#8220;Still, I reckon I&#8217;ll handle
this my own way&mdash;unless your father&#8217;s daughter
wants to go partners with me in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a look intended to crush his impudence.
&#8220;No, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ate a breakfast which she had the cook prepare
hurriedly for him, and departed on the horse
for which she had telephoned to the nearest livery
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
stable. Melissy was a singularly fearless girl; yet
she watched him go with a decided relief, for which
she could not account. He rode, she observed, like
a centaur&mdash;flat-backed, firm in the saddle with the
easy negligence of a plainsman. He turned as he
started, and waved a hand debonairly at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have any luck, I&#8217;ll bring back one of the
Roaring Fork bunch with me&mdash;a present for a good
girl, Miss Melissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned on her heel and went inside. Anger
pulsed fiercely through her. He laughed at her,
made fun of her, and yet called her by her first
name. How dared he treat her so! Worst of all,
she read admiration bold and unveiled in the eyes
that mocked her.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Flatray, riding toward town
with his prisoner in front of him, heard a sudden
sharp summons to throw up his hands. A man had
risen from behind a boulder, and held him covered
steadily.</p>
<p>Jack looked at the fellow without complying. He
needed no second glance to tell him that this man
was not one to be trifled with. &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;
he demanded quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind who I am. Reach for the sky.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captured outlaw had given a little whoop,
and was now loosening the rope from his neck.
&#8220;You&#8217;re the goods, Cap! I knew the boys would
pull it off for me, but I didn&#8217;t reckon on it so durn
soon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; ordered the man behind the gun, without
moving his eyes from Flatray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a clam,&#8221; retorted the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting for those hands to go up; but I&#8217;ll not
wait long, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s hands went up reluctantly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got
the call,&#8221; he admitted.</p>
<p>They led him a couple of hundred yards from
the trail and tied him hand and foot. Before they
left him the outlaw whom he had captured evened
his score. Three times he struck Flatray on the
head with the butt of his revolver. He was lying
on the ground bleeding and senseless when they
rode away toward the hills.</p>
<p>Jack came to himself with a blinding headache.
It was some time before he realized what had happened.
As soon as he did he set about freeing himself.
This was a matter of a few minutes. With
the handkerchief that was around his neck he tied
up his wounds. Fortunately his hair was very thick
and this had saved him from a fractured skull.
Dizzily he got to his feet, found his horse, and
started toward Mesa.</p>
<p>Not many people were on the streets when the
sheriff passed through the suburbs of the little
town, for it was about the breakfast hour. One
stout old negro mammy stopped to stare in surprise
at his bloody head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laws a mussy, Mistah Flatray, what they done
be&#8217;n a-doin&#8217; to you-all?&#8221; she asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>The sheriff hardly saw her. He was chewing
the bitter cud of defeat and was absorbed in his
thoughts. He was still young enough to have
counted on the effect upon Melissy of his return
to town with one of the abductors as his prisoner.</p>
<p>It happened that she was on the porch watering
her flower boxes when he passed the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221; she cried, and on the heels of her exclamation:
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you? Been
hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>A gray pallor had pushed through the tan of
her cheeks. She knew her heart was beating fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bumped into a piece of bad luck,&#8221; he grinned,
and told her briefly what had occurred.</p>
<p>She took him into the house and washed his head
for him. After she saw how serious the cuts were
she insisted on sending for a doctor. When his
wounds were dressed she fed him and made him
lie down and sleep on her father&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p>The sun was sliding down the heavens to a
crotch in the hills before he joined her again. She
was in front of the house clipping her roses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the invalid better?&#8221; she asked him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a false alarm. But he did have a mighty
thumping headache that has gone now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering why you didn&#8217;t meet Lieutenant
O&#8217;Connor. He must have taken the road
you came in on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s eyes lit. &#8220;Is Bucky here already?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He was. He&#8217;s gone. I was greatly disappointed
in him. He&#8217;s not half the man you think he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but he is. Everybody says so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw a more conceited man, or a more
hateful one. There&#8217;s something about him&mdash;oh, I
don&#8217;t know. But he isn&#8217;t good. I&#8217;m sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His reputation isn&#8217;t of that kind. They say
he&#8217;s devoted to his wife and kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife and children.&#8221; Melissy recalled the
smoldering admiration in his bold eyes. She laughed
shortly. &#8220;That finishes him with me. He&#8217;s married,
is he? Well, I know the kind of husband
he is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack flashed a quick look at her. He guessed
what she meant. But this did not square at all
with what his friends had told him of O&#8217;Connor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he ask for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He said he preferred to play a lone hand.
His manner was unpleasant all the time. He knows
it all. I could see that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, he&#8217;s a crackerjack in his line. Have
you heard from your father since he set out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to start to-night with a posse
for the Cache. If O&#8217;Connor comes back, tell him
I&#8217;ll follow the Roaring Fork.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not go this time without a gun, Jack,&#8221;
she said with a ghost of a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I want to make good this trip.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You did splendidly before. Not one man in
a hundred would have done so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a wonder,&#8221; he admitted with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will take care of yourself&mdash;not be
foolish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t aim to take up residence in Boot Hill
cemetery if I can help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Boone and his men are dangerous characters.
They are playing for high stakes. They would
snuff your life out as quick as they would wink.
Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me to lie down before Dunc
Boone, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No-o. Only don&#8217;t be reckless. I told father
the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her dear concern for him went to Jack&#8217;s head,
but he steadied himself before he answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got one real good reason for not being reckless.
I&#8217;ll tell you what it is some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her shy, alarmed eyes fled his at once. She
began an account of how her father had gathered
his posse and where she thought he must have
gone.</p>
<p>After dinner Jack went downtown. Melissy did
some household tasks and presently moved out to
the cool porch. She was just thinking about going
back in when a barefoot boy ran past and whistled.
From the next house a second youngster emerged.</p>
<p>&#8220;That you, Jimmie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Betcherlife. Say, &#8217;ve you heard about the
sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Jack Flatray! Course I have. The
Roaring Fork outfit ambushed him, beat him up,
and made him hit the trail for town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw! That ain&#8217;t news. He&#8217;s started back after
them again. Left jes&#8217; a little while ago. I saw
him go&mdash;him &#8217;n&#8217; Farnum &#8217;n&#8217; Charley Hymer &#8217;n&#8217;
Hal Yarnell &#8217;n&#8217; Mr. Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet they git &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bet they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, course they&#8217;ll git &#8217;em, Tom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other youngster assumed an air of mystery.
He swelled his chest and strutted a step or two
nearer. Urbane condescension oozed from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jimmie. C&#8217;n you keep a secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Course I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t ever snitch?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;I&#8217;m Black MacQueen, the captain
of the Roaring Fork bad men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Incredulity stared from Jimmie&#8217;s bulging
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You betcher. I&#8217;m him, here in disguise as a
kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The magnificent boldness of this claim stole Jimmie&#8217;s
breath for an instant. He was two years
younger than his friend, but he did not quite know
whether to applaud or to jeer. Before he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
make up his mind a light laugh rippled to them
from behind the vines on the Lee porch.</p>
<p>The disguised outlaw and his friend were
startled. Both fled swiftly, with all the pretense
of desperate necessity young conspirators love to
assume.</p>
<p>Melissy went into the house and the laughter
died from her lips. She knew that either her
father&#8217;s posse or that of Jack Flatray would come
into touch with the outlaws eventually. When the
clash came there would be a desperate battle. Men
would be killed. She prayed it might not be one
of those for whom she cared most.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE REAL BUCKY AND THE FALSE</h3>
</div>

<p>Number seven was churning its way furiously
through brown Arizona. The day
had been hot, with a palpitating heat
which shimmered over the desert waste. Defiantly
the sun had gone down beyond the horizon, a great
ball of fire, leaving behind a brilliant splash of bold
colors. Now this, too, had disappeared. Velvet
night had transformed the land. Over the distant
mountains had settled a smoke-blue film, which left
them vague and indefinite.</p>
<p>Only three passengers rode in the Pullman car.
One was a commercial traveler, busy making up his
weekly statement to the firm. Another was a Boston
lady, in gold-rimmed glasses and a costume that
helped the general effect of frigidity. The third
looked out of the open window at the distant hills.
He was a slender young fellow, tanned almost to
a coffee brown, with eyes of Irish blue which sometimes
bubbled with fun and sometimes were hard
as chisel steel. Wide-shouldered and lean-flanked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
he was, with well-packed muscles, which rippled like
those of a tiger.</p>
<p>At Chiquita the train stopped, but took up again
almost instantly its chant of the rail. Meanwhile,
a man had swung himself to the platform of the
smoker. He passed through that car, the two day
coaches, and on to the sleeper; his keen, restless
eyes inspected every passenger in the course of his
transit. Opposite the young man in the Pullman
he stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I ask if you are Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My name, seh.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man in the seat had slewed his head
around sharply, and made answer with a crisp, businesslike
directness.</p>
<p>The new-comer smiled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to introduce
myself, lieutenant. My name is Flatray. I&#8217;ve come
to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, Mr. Flatray. I hope that
together we can work this thing out right. MacQueen
has gathered a bunch that ought to be cleaned
out, and I reckon now&#8217;s the time to do it. I&#8217;ve been
reading about him for a year. I&#8217;ve got a notion
he&#8217;s about the ablest thing in bad men this Territory
has seen for a good many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatray sat down on the seat opposite O&#8217;Connor.
A smile flicked across his face, and vanished. &#8220;I&#8217;m
of that opinion myself, lieutenant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all about this affair of the West kidnapping,&#8221;
the ranger suggested.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>The other man told the story while O&#8217;Connor
listened, alert to catch every point of the narrative.</p>
<p>The face of the lieutenant of rangers was a boyish
one&mdash;eager, genial, and frank; yet, none the
less, strength lay in the close-gripped jaw and in
the steady, watchful eye. His lithe, tense body was
like a coiled spring; and that, too, though he seemed
to be very much at ease.</p>
<p>With every sentence that the other spoke, O&#8217;Connor
was judging Flatray, appraising him for a fine
specimen of a hard-bitten breed&mdash;a vigilant frontiersman,
competent to the finger tips. Yet he was
conscious that, in spite of the man&#8217;s graceful ease
and friendly smile, he did not like Flatray. He
would not ask for a better man beside him in a
tight pinch; but he could not deny that something
sinister which breathed from his sardonic, devil-may-care
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how the land lies,&#8221; the sheriff concluded.
&#8220;My deputies have got the pass to the
south blocked; Lee is closing in through Elkhorn;
and Fox, with a strong posse, is combing the hills
beyond Dead Man&#8217;s Cache. There&#8217;s only one way
out for him, and that is over Powderhorn Pass.
Word has just reached us that MacQueen is moving
in that direction. He is evidently figuring to
slip out over the hills during the night. I&#8217;ve arranged
for us to be met at Barker&#8217;s Tank by a
couple of the boys, with horses. We&#8217;ll drop off the
train quietly when it slows up to water, so that none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
of his spies can get word of our movements to him.
By hard riding we&#8217;d ought to reach Powderhorn
in time to head him off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger asked incisive questions, had the
topography of the country explained to him with
much detail, and decided at last that Flatray was
right. If MacQueen were trying to slip out, they
might trap him at the pass; if not, by closing it they
would put the cork in the bottle that held him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it, seh. Y&#8217;u know this country better
than I do, and I&#8217;ll give y&#8217;u a free hand. Unless
there&#8217;s a slip up in your calculations, you&#8217;d ought
to be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough, lieutenant. I&#8217;m betting on those
plans myself,&#8221; the other answered promptly, and
added, as he looked out into the night: &#8220;By that
notch in the hills, we&#8217;d ought to be close to the tank
now. She&#8217;s slowing up. I reckon we can slip out
to the vestibule, and get off at the far side of the
track without being noticed much.&#8221;</p>
<p>This they found easy enough. Five minutes later
number seven was steaming away into the distant
desert. Flatray gave a sharp, shrill whistle; and
from behind some sand dunes emerged two men
and four horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything new?&#8221; asked the sheriff as they came
nearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing, cap,&#8221; answered one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, shake hands with the famous Lieutenant
O&#8217;Connor,&#8221; said Flatray, with a sneer hid by the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
darkness. &#8220;Lieutenant, let me make you acquainted
with Jeff Jackson and Buck Lane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much obliged to meet you,&#8221; grinned Buck as he
shook hands.</p>
<p>They mounted and rode toward the notch in the
hills that had been pointed out to the ranger. The
moon was up; and a cold, silvery light flooded the
plain. Seen in this setting, the great, painted desert
held more of mystery, of beauty, and less of the
dead monotony that glared endlessly from arid, barren
reaches. The sky of stars stretched infinitely
far, and added to the effect of magnitude.</p>
<p>The miles slipped behind them as they moved forward,
hour after hour, their horses holding to the
running walk that is the peculiar gait of the cow
country. They rode in silence, with the loose seat
and straight back of the vaquero. Except the
ranger, all were dressed for riding&mdash;Flatray in
corduroys and half-knee laced boots; his men in
overalls, chaps, flannel shirts, and the broad-brimmed
sombrero of the Southwest. All four
were young men; but there was an odd difference
in the expressions of their faces.</p>
<p>Jackson and Lane had the hard-lined faces, with
something grim and stony in them, of men who
ride far and hard with their lives in their hands.
The others were of a higher type. Flatray&#8217;s dark
eyes were keen, bold, and restless. One might have
guessed him a man of temperament, capable of any
extremes of conduct&mdash;often the victim of his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
ungovernable whims and passions. Just as he
looked a picture of all the passions of youth run
to seed, so the ranger seemed to show them in
flower. There was something fine and strong and
gallant in his debonair manner. His warm smile
went out to a world that pleased him mightily.</p>
<p>They rode steadily, untired and untiring. The
light of dawn began to flicker from one notched
summit to another. Out of the sandy waste they
came to a water hole, paused for a drink, and passed
on. For the delay of half an hour might mean the
escape of their prey.</p>
<p>They came into the country of crumbling mesas
and painted cliffs, of hillsides where greasewood
and giant cactus struggled from the parched earth.
This they traversed until they came to plateaus, terminating
in foothills, crevassed by gorges deep and
narrow. The cañons grew steeper, rock ridges
more frequent. Gradually the going became more
difficult.</p>
<p>Trails they seldom followed. Washes, with sides
like walls, confronted them. The ponies dropped
down and clambered up again like mountain goats.
Gradually they were ascending into the upper country,
which led to the wild stretches where the outlaws
lurked. In these watersheds were heavy pine
forests, rising from the gulches along the shoulders
of the peaks.</p>
<p>A maze of cañons, hopelessly lost in the hill tangle
into which they had plunged, led deviously to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
twisting pass, through which they defiled, to drop
into a vista of rolling waves of forest-clad hills.
Among these wound countless hidden gulches,
known only to those who rode from out them on
nefarious night errands.</p>
<p>The ranger noted every landmark, and catalogued
in his mind&#8217;s map every gorge and peak; from what
he saw, he guessed much of which he could not
be sure. It would be hard to say when his suspicions
first became aroused. But as they rode, without
stopping, through what he knew must be Powderhorn
Pass, as the men about him quietly grouped
themselves so as to cut off any escape he might
attempt, as they dropped farther and farther into
the meshes of that forest-crowned net which he
knew to be the Roaring Fork country, he did not
need to be told he was in the power of MacQueen&#8217;s
gang.</p>
<p>Yet he gave no sign of what he knew. As daylight
came, so that they could see each other distinctly,
his face showed no shadow of doubt. It
was his cue to be a simple victim of credulity, and
he played it to the finish.</p>
<p>Without warning, through a narrow gulch which
might have been sought in vain for ten years by
a stranger, they passed into the rim of a bowl-shaped
valley. Timber covered it from edge to
edge, but over to the left a keen eye could see a
thinning of the foliage. Toward this they went,
following the sidehill and gradually dipping down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
through heavy underbrush. Before him the officer
of rangers saw daylight, and presently a corral, low
roofs, and grazing horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like some one lives here,&#8221; he remarked
amiably.</p>
<p>They were already riding into the open. In
front of one of the log cabins the man who had
called himself Flatray swung from his saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better &#8217;light, lieutenant,&#8221; he suggested carelessly.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll eat breakfast here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t care if we do. I could eat a leather mail
sack, I&#8217;m that hungry,&#8221; the ranger answered, as he,
too, descended.</p>
<p>His guide was looking at him with an expression
of open, malevolent triumph. He could scarce keep
it back long enough to get the effect he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ll eat breakfast here&mdash;and dinner, and
supper, and breakfast to-morrow, and then about
two more breakfasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll be too busy to sit around here,&#8221;
laughed his prisoner.</p>
<p>The other ignored his comment. &#8220;And after that,
it ain&#8217;t likely you&#8217;ll do much more eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite get the point of that joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get it soon enough! You&#8217;d <i>savez</i> it now,
if you weren&#8217;t a muttonhead. As it is, I&#8217;ll have to
explain it. Do you remember capturing Tony
Chaves two years ago, lieutenant?&#8221;</p>
<p>The ranger nodded, with surprise in his round,
innocent eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to him?&#8221; demanded the other.
A child could have seen that he was ridden by a
leering, savage triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed trying to escape four days later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who killed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. It was necessary. I regretted it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden spasm of cruelty swept over the face
of the man confronting him. &#8220;Tony was my
partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your partner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ve been wanting to say &#8216;How
d&#8217;ye do?&#8217; ever since, Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor. I&#8217;m
right glad to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; He did, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll soak through, by and by. Chew on this:
You&#8217;ve got just ninety-six hours to live&mdash;exactly
as long as Tony lived after you caught him! You&#8217;ll
be killed trying to escape. It will be necessary, just
as you say it was with him; but I reckon I&#8217;ll not do
any regretting to speak of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would murder me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t particular about the word I use.&#8221;
MacQueen leaned against the side of his horse, his
arm thrown across its neck, and laughed in slow
maliciousness. &#8220;Execute is the word I use, though&mdash;if
you want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had made no motion toward his weapon, nor
had O&#8217;Connor; but the latter knew without looking
that he was covered vigilantly by both of the other
men.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And who are you?&#8221; the ranger asked, though
he was quite sure of the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men call me Black MacQueen,&#8221; drawled the
other.</p>
<p>&#8220;MacQueen! But you said&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I was Flatray. Yep&mdash;I lied.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor appeared to grope with this in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;One has to stretch the truth sometimes in my
profession,&#8221; went on the outlaw smoothly. &#8220;It may
interest you to know that yesterday I passed as
Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor. When I was O&#8217;Connor I
arrested Flatray; and now that I am Flatray I have
arrested O&#8217;Connor. Turn about is fair play, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Interesting, if true,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor retorted easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can bank on its truth, my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;re actually going to kill me in cold
blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The black eyes narrowed. &#8220;Just as I would a
dog,&#8221; said the outlaw, with savage emphasis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. I&#8217;ve done you no harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen glanced at him contemptuously. The
famous Bucky O&#8217;Connor looked about as competent
as a boy in the pimply age.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had better sense. Do you think
I would have brought you to Dead Man&#8217;s Cache if
I had intended you to go away alive? I&#8217;m afraid,
Lieutenant Bucky O&#8217;Connor, that you&#8217;re a much
overrated man. Your reputation sure would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
blown up, if you had lived. You ought to thank
me for preserving it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Preserving it&mdash;how?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By bumping you off before you&#8217;ve lost it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sho! You wouldn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; the ranger murmured
ineffectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see. Jeff, I put him in your charge.
Search him, and take him to Hank&#8217;s cabin. I hold
you responsible for him. Bring me any papers you
find on him. When I find time, I&#8217;ll drop around
and see that you&#8217;re keeping him safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bucky was searched, and his weapons and papers
removed. After being handcuffed, he was chained
to a heavy staple, which had been driven into one
of the log walls. He was left alone, and the door
was locked; but he could hear Jeff moving about
outside.</p>
<p>With the closing of the door the vacuous look
slipped from his face like a mask. The loose-lipped,
lost-dog expression was gone. He looked
once more alert, competent, fit for the emergency.
It had been his cue to let his adversary underestimate
him. During the long night ride he had had
chances to escape, had he desired to do so. But
this had been the last thing he wanted.</p>
<p>The outlaws had chosen to take him to their fastness
in the hills. He would back himself to use
the knowledge they were thrusting upon him, to
bring about their undoing. Only one factor in the
case had come upon him as a surprise. He had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
reckoned that they would have a personal grudge
against him. And this was a factor that might
upset all his calculations.</p>
<p>It meant that he was playing against time, with
the chances of the game all against him. He had
forty-eight hours in which to escape&mdash;and he was
handcuffed, chained, locked up, and guarded. Truly,
the outlook was not radiant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A PHOTOGRAPH</h3>
</div>

<p>On the third morning Beauchamp Lee returned
to Mesa&mdash;unshaven, dusty, and
fagged with hard riding. He brought
with him a handbill which he had picked up in the
street. Melissy hung over him and ministered to
his needs. While he was eating breakfast he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No luck yet, honey. He&#8217;s hiding in some pocket
of the hills, I reckon; and likely there he&#8217;ll stay till
the hunt is past. They don&#8217;t make them any slicker
than Dunc, dad gum his ugly hide!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that paper?&#8221; his daughter asked.</p>
<p>Lee curbed a disposition toward bad language,
as he viewed it with disgust. &#8220;This here is bulletin
number one, girl. It&#8217;s the cheekiest, most impudent
thing I ever saw. MacQueen serves notice to all
the people of this county to keep out of this fight.
Also, he mentions me and Jack Flatray by name&mdash;warning
us that, if we sit in the game, hell will be
popping for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do? I&#8217;ll get back to my boys fast as horseflesh
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
will get me there, once I&#8217;ve had a talk with
that beef buyer from Kansas City I made an appointment
to see before this thing broke loose. You
don&#8217;t allow I&#8217;m going to let any rustler dictate to
me what I&#8217;ll do and what I won&#8217;t&mdash;do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you reckon he had this printed?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon, I know. Late last night a
masked man woke up Jim Snell. You know, he
sleeps in a room at the back of the printing office.
Well, this fellow made him dress, set up this bill,
and run off five hundred copies while he stood over
him. I&#8217;ll swan I never heard of such cheek!&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy told what she had to tell&mdash;after which
her father shaved, took a bath, and went out to
meet the buyer from Kansas City. His business
kept him until noon. After dinner Melissy&#8217;s saddle
horse was brought around, and she joined her father
to ride back with him for a few miles.</p>
<p>About three o&#8217;clock she kissed him good-bye, and
turned homeward. After she had passed the point
where the Silver Creek trail ran into the road she
heard the sound of a galloping horse behind. A
rider was coming along the trail toward town. He
gained on her rapidly, and presently a voice hailed
her gayly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The top o&#8217; the mornin&#8217; to you, Miss &#8217;Lissie.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew up to wait for him. &#8220;My name is still
Miss Lee,&#8221; she told him mildly, by way of correction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad it is, but we can change it in three
minutes at any time, my dear,&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>She had been prepared to be more friendly toward
him, but at this she froze again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you leave Mrs. O&#8217;Connor and the children
well?&#8221; she asked pointedly, looking directly at him.</p>
<p>His smile vanished, and he stared at her in a very
strange fashion. She had taken the wind completely
out of his sails. It had not occurred to him that
O&#8217;Connor might be a married man. Nor did he
know but that it might be a trick to catch him. He
did the only thing he could do&mdash;made answer in an
ironic fashion, which might mean anything or
nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw at once that the topic did not allure him,
and pushed home her advantage. &#8220;You must miss
Mrs. O&#8217;Connor when you are away on duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Must I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the children, too. By the way, what are
their names?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting up a right smart interest in my
family, all of a sudden,&#8221; he countered.</p>
<p>&#8220;One can&#8217;t talk about the weather all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>He boldly decided to slay the illusion of domesticity.
&#8220;If you want to know, I have neither wife
nor children.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve heard about them all,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard of Mrs. O&#8217;Connor, no doubt;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
but she happens to be the wife of a cousin of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The look which she flashed at him held more than
doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I give
you my word that I&#8217;m not married.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had left the road, and were following a
short cut which wound down toward Tonti, in and
out among the great boulders. The town, dwarfed
to microscopic size by distance, looked, in the glare
of the sunlight, as if it were made of white chalk.
Along the narrow trail they went singly, Melissy
leading the way.</p>
<p>She made no answer, but at the first opportunity
he forced his horse to a level with hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you heard what I said,&#8221; he challenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;The subject is of no importance to me,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important to me. I&#8217;m not going to have
you doing me an injustice. I tell you I&#8217;m not married.
You&#8217;ve got to believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mind was again alive with suspicions. Jack
had told her Bucky O&#8217;Connor was married, and he
must have known what he was talking about.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you are married or not.
I am of the opinion that Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor has
a wife and three children. More than once I have
been told so,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to know a heap about the gentleman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know what I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than I do, perhaps,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>Her eyes dilated. He could see suspicion take
hold of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean you think I&#8217;m not Bucky O&#8217;Connor?&#8221;
He had pushed his pony forward so as to
cut off her advance, and both had halted for the
moment.</p>
<p>She looked at him with level, fearless eyes. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know who you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you think I&#8217;m not Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor
of the rangers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether you are or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing like making sure. Just look
over this letter, please.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did so. It was from the governor of the
Territory to the ranger officer. While he was very
complimentary as to past services, the governor
made it plain that he thought O&#8217;Connor must at all
hazards succeed in securing the release of Simon
West. This would be necessary for the good name
of the Territory. Otherwise, a widespread report
would go out that Arizona was a lawless place in
which to live.</p>
<p>Melissy folded the letter and handed it back. &#8220;I
beg your pardon, Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor. I see that
I was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it, my dear. We all make mistakes.&#8221;
He had that curious mocking smile which so often
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
hovered about his lips. She felt as though he were
deriding her&mdash;as though his words held some hidden
irony which she could not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor seems very anxious to have you
succeed. It will be a black eye for Arizona if this
band of outlaws is not apprehended. You don&#8217;t
think, do you, that they will do Mr. West any
harm, if their price is not paid? They would never
dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took this up almost as though he resented it.
&#8220;They would dare anything. I reckon you&#8217;ll have
to get up early in the mornin&#8217; to find a gamer man
than Black MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it game to hurt an old man whom
he has in his power. But you mustn&#8217;t let it come
to that. You must save him. Are you making
any progress? Have you run down any of the
band? And while I think of it&mdash;have you seen to-day&#8217;s
paper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest story on the front page is about
the West case. It seems that this MacQueen wired
to Chicago to Mr. Lucas, president of one of the
lines on the Southwestern system, that they would
release Mr. West for three hundred thousand dollars
in gold. He told him a letter had been mailed
to the agent at Mesa, telling under just what conditions
the money was to be turned over; and he
ended with a threat that, if steps were taken to capture
the gang, or if the money were not handed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
over at the specified time, Mr. West would disappear
forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the paper say whether the money would be
turned over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It said that Mr. Lucas was going to get into
touch with the outlaws at once, to effect the release
of his chief.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gleam of triumph flashed in the eyes of the
man. &#8220;That&#8217;s sure the best way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t help your reputation, will it?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Won&#8217;t people say that you failed on this
case?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed softly, as if at some hidden source
of mirth. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if they did say that
Bucky O&#8217;Connor hadn&#8217;t made good this time.
They&#8217;ll figure he tried to ride herd on a job too big
for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her surprised eye brooded over this, too. Here
he was defending the outlaw chief, and rejoicing at
his own downfall. There seemed to be no end to
the contradictions in this man. She was to run
across another tangled thread of the puzzle a few
minutes later.</p>
<p>She had dismounted to let him tighten the saddle
cinch. Owing to the heat, he had been carrying
his coat in front of him. He tossed it on a boulder
by the side of the trail, in such a way that the inside
pocket hung down. From it slid some papers and
a photograph. Melissy looked down at the picture,
then instantly stooped and picked it up. For it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
a photograph of a very charming woman and three
children, and across the bottom of it was written
a line.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;To Bucky, from his loving wife and children.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The girl handed it to the man without a word,
and looked him full in the face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bowled out, by ginger!&#8221; he said, with a light
laugh.</p>
<p>But as she continued to look at him&mdash;a man of
promise, who had plainly traveled far on the road
to ruin&mdash;the conviction grew on her that the sweet-faced
woman in the photograph was no loving wife
of his. He was a man who might easily take a
woman&#8217;s fancy, but not one to hold her love for
years through the stress of life. Moreover, Bucky
O&#8217;Connor held the respect of all men. She had
heard him spoken of, and always with a meed of
affection that is given to few men. Whoever this
graceless scamp was, he was not the lieutenant of
rangers.</p>
<p>The words slipped out before she could stop them:
&#8220;You&#8217;re not Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Playing on that string again, are you?&#8221; he
jeered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you know who I&#8217;m not, perhaps you can
tell me, too, who I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that instant before she spoke, while her steady
eyes rested on him, she put together many things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
which had puzzled her. All of them pointed to one
conclusion. Even now her courage did not fail
her. She put it into words quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are that villain Black MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her in surprise. &#8220;By God, girl&mdash;you&#8217;re
right. I&#8217;m MacQueen, though I don&#8217;t know
how you guessed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I kept from guessing it so
long. I can see it, now, as plain as day, in all that
you have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that they measured strength silently with
their eyes. If the situation had clarified itself, with
the added knowledge of the girl had come new
problems. Let her return to Mesa, and he could
no longer pose as O&#8217;Connor; and it was just the
audacity of this double play that delighted him.
He was the most reckless man on earth; he loved
to take chances. He wanted to fool the officers to
his heart&#8217;s content, and then jeer at them afterward.
Hitherto everything had come his way.</p>
<p>But if this girl should go home, he could not
show his face at Mesa; and the spice of the thing
would be gone. He was greatly taken with her
beauty, her daring, and the charm of high spirits
which radiated from her. Again and again he had
found himself drawn back to her. He was not in
love with her in any legitimate sense; but he knew
now that, if he could see her no more, life would
be a savorless thing, at least until his fancy had
spent itself. Moreover, her presence at Dead Man&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
Cache would be a safeguard. With her in his
power, Lee and Flatray, the most persistent of his
hunters, would not dare to move against the outlaws.</p>
<p>Inclination and interest worked together. He
decided to take her back with him to the country
of hidden pockets and gulches. There, in time, he
would win her love&mdash;so his vanity insisted. After
that they would slip away from the scene of his
crimes, and go back to the world from which he
had years since vanished.</p>
<p>The dream grew on him. It got hold of his
imagination. For a moment he saw himself as the
man he had been meant for&mdash;the man he might
have been, if he had been able to subdue his evil
nature. He saw himself respected, a power in the
community, going down to a serene old age, with
this woman and their children by his side. Then
he laughed derisively, and brushed aside the vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t the real Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor arrive
to expose you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real Bucky is handcuffed and guarded at
Dead Man&#8217;s Cache. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s enjoying
himself to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting quite a collection of prisoners.
You&#8217;ll be starting a penitentiary on your own account
soon,&#8221; she told him sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;m taking another one back
with me to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lady this time&mdash;Miss Melissy Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>His words shook her. An icy hand seemed to
clamp upon her heart. The blood ebbed even from
her lips, but her brave eyes never faltered from
his.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you war on women, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her his most ironic bow. &#8220;I don&#8217;t war
on you, my dear. You shall have half of my kingdom,
if you ask it&mdash;and all my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t use either,&#8221; she told him quietly. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m only a girl. If you have a spark of manliness
in you, surely you won&#8217;t take me a prisoner among
those wild, bad men of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those wild, bad men of mine are lambs when
I give the word. They wouldn&#8217;t lift a hand against
you. And there is a woman there&mdash;the mother of
one of my boys, who was shot. We&#8217;ll have you
chaperoned for fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I say I won&#8217;t go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go if I strap you to your saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Melissy that she made no
further resistance. The sudden, wolfish gleam in
his eyes had told her that he meant what he said.
It was like her, too, that she made no outcry; that
she did not shed tears or plead with him. A gallant
spirit inhabited that slim, girlish body; and she
yielded to the inevitable with quiet dignity. This
surprised him greatly, and stung his reluctant admiration.
At the same time, it set her apart from
him and hedged her with spiritual barriers. Her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
body might ride with him into captivity; she was
still captain of her soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a game one,&#8221; he told her, as he helped
her to the saddle.</p>
<p>She did not answer, but looked straightforward
between her horse&#8217;s ears, without seeing him, waiting
for him to give the word to start.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>IN DEAD MAN&#8217;S CACHE</h3>
</div>

<p>Not since the start of their journey had
Melissy broken silence, save to answer, in
few words as possible, the questions
put to her by the outlaw. Yet her silence had not
been sullenness. It had been the barrier which she
had set up between them&mdash;one which he could not
break down short of actual roughness.</p>
<p>Of this she could not accuse him. Indeed, he
had been thoughtful of her comfort. At sunset they
had stopped by a spring, and he had shared with
her such food as he had. Moreover, he had insisted
that she should rest for a while before they
took up the last stretch of the way.</p>
<p>It was midnight now, and they had been traveling
for many hours over rough mountain trails.
There was more strength than one would look for
in so slender a figure, yet Melissy was drooping
with fatigue.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not far now. We&#8217;ll be there in a few minutes,&#8221;
MacQueen promised her.</p>
<p>They were ascending a narrow trail which ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
along the sidehill through the timber. Presently
they topped the summit, and the ground fell away
from their feet to a bowl-shaped valley, over which
the silvery moonshine played so that the basin
seemed to swim in a magic sea of light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Cache,&#8221; he said to her.</p>
<p>She was surprised out of her silence. &#8220;Dead
Man&#8217;s Cache?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been called that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew, but she wanted to see if he would
tell a story which showed so plainly his own ruthlessness.</p>
<p>He hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a man named Havens. He had a
reputation as a bad man, and I reckon he deserved
it&mdash;if brand blotting, mail rustling, and shooting
citizens are the credentials to win that title. Hard
pressed on account of some deviltry, he drifted into
this country, and was made welcome by those living
here. The best we had was his. He was fed, outfitted,
and kept safe from the law that was looking
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would figure he was under big obligations
to the men that did this for him&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t you?
But he was born skunk. When his chance came he
offered to betray these men to the law, in exchange
for a pardon for his own sneaking hide. The letter
was found, and it was proved he wrote it. What
ought those men to have done to him, Miss &#8217;Lissie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; She shuddered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s got to be law, even in a place like this.
We make our own laws, and the men that stay here
have got to abide by them. Our law said this man
must die. He died.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not ask him how. The story went that
the outlaws whom the wretched man had tried to
sell let him escape on purpose&mdash;that, just as he
thought he was free of them, their mocking laughter
came to him from the rocks all around. He was
completely surrounded. They had merely let him
run into a trap. He escaped again, wandered without
food for days, and again discovered that they
had been watching him all the time. Turn whichever
way he would, their rifles warned him back.
He stumbled on, growing weaker and weaker. They
would neither capture him nor let him go.</p>
<p>For nearly a week the cruel game went on. Frequently
he heard their voices in the hills about him.
Sometimes he would call out to them pitifully to put
him out of his misery. Only their horrible laughter
answered. When he had reached the limit of endurance
he lay down and died.</p>
<p>And the man who had engineered that heartless
revenge was riding beside her. He had been ready
to tell her the whole story, if she had asked for it,
and equally ready to justify it. Nothing could have
shown her more plainly the character of the villain
into whose hands she had fallen.</p>
<p>They descended into the valley, winding in and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
out until they came suddenly upon ranch houses
and a corral in a cleared space.</p>
<p>A man came out of the shadows into the moonlight
to meet them. Instantly Melissy recognized
his walk. It was Boone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you,&#8221; MacQueen said coldly. &#8220;Any of
the rest of the boys up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not a dozen words had passed between them, but
the girl sensed hostility. She was not surprised.
Dunc Boone was not the man to take second place
in any company of riff-raff, nor was MacQueen
one likely to yield the supremacy he had fought to
gain.</p>
<p>The latter swung from the saddle and lifted Melissy
from hers. As her feet struck the ground
her face for the first time came full into the moonlight.</p>
<p>Boone stifled a startled oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melissy Lee!&#8221; Like a swiftly reined horse he
swung around upon his chief. &#8220;What devil&#8217;s work
is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My business, Dunc!&#8221; the other retorted in suave
insult.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, no! I make it mine. This young
lady&#8217;s a friend of mine&mdash;or used to be. <i>Sabe</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>sabe</i> you&#8217;d better not try to sit in at this game,
my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boone swung abruptly upon Melissy. &#8220;How
come you here, girl? Tell me!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>And in three sentences she explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your play? Whyfor did you bring her?&#8221;
the Arkansan demanded of MacQueen.</p>
<p>The latter stood balanced on his heels with his
feet wide apart. There was a scornful grin on his
face, but his eyes were fixed warily on the other
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was I to do with her, Mr. Buttinski? She
found out who I was. Could I send her home?
If I did how was I to fix it so I could go to Mesa
when it&#8217;s necessary till we get this ransom business
arranged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But you understand she&#8217;s a friend
of mine. I&#8217;ll not have her hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go to the devil! I&#8217;m not in the habit of
hurting young ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen swung on his heel insolently and
knocked on the door of a cabin near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m here when you need me,&#8221;
Boone told Melissy in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not forget,&#8221; the girl made answer in a
murmur.</p>
<p>The wrinkled face of a Mexican woman appeared
presently at a window. MacQueen jabbered a sentence
or two in her language. She looked at Melissy
and answered.</p>
<p>The girl had not lived in Southern Arizona for
twenty years without having a working knowledge
of Spanish. Wherefore, she knew that her captor
had ordered his own room prepared for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>While they waited for this to be made ready MacQueen
hummed a snatch of a popular song. It
happened to be a love ditty. Boone ground his
teeth and glared at him, which appeared to amuse
the other ruffian immensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stay up on our account,&#8221; MacQueen suggested
presently with a malicious laugh. &#8220;We&#8217;re
not needing a chaperone any to speak of.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican woman announced that the bedroom
was ready and MacQueen escorted Melissy to the
door of the room. He stood aside with mock gallantry
to let her pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have to lock you in,&#8221; he apologized airily.
&#8220;Not that it would do you any good to escape.
We&#8217;d have you again inside of twenty-four hours.
This bit of the hills takes a heap of knowing. But
we don&#8217;t want you running away. You&#8217;re too tired.
So I lock the door and lie down on the porch under
your window. <i>Adios, señorita.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy heard the key turn in the lock, and was
grateful for the respite given her by the night.
She was glad, too, that Boone was here. She knew
him for a villain, but she hoped he would stand
between her and MacQueen if the latter proved unruly
in his attentions. Her guess was that Boone
was jealous of the other&mdash;of his authority with
the gang to which they both belonged, and now of
his relationship to her. Out of this division might
come hope for her.</p>
<p>So tired was she that, in spite of her alarms,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
sleep took her almost as soon as her head touched
the pillow. When she awakened the sun was shining
in at her window above the curtain strung across
its lower half.</p>
<p>Some one was knocking at the door. When she
asked who was there, in a voice which could not
conceal its tremors, the answer came in feminine
tones:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis I&mdash;Rosario Chaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican woman was not communicative, nor
did she appear to be sympathetic. The plight of
this girl might have moved even an unresponsive
heart, but Rosario showed a stolid face to her distress.
What had to be said, she said. For the rest,
she declined conversation absolutely.</p>
<p>Breakfast was served Melissy in her room, after
which Rosario led her outdoors. The woman gave
her to understand that she might walk about the
cleared space, but must not pass into the woods
beyond. To point the need of obedience, Rosario
seated herself on the porch, and began doing some
drawn work upon which she was engaged.</p>
<p>Melissy walked toward the corral, but did not reach
it. An old hag was seated in a chair beside one of
the log cabins. From the color of her skin the girl
judged her to be an Indian squaw. She wore moccasins,
a dirty and shapeless one-piece dress, and
a big sunbonnet, in which her head was buried.</p>
<p>Sitting on the floor of the porch, about fifteen feet
from her, was a hard-faced customer, with stony
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
eyes like those of a snake. He was sewing on a
bridle that had given way. Melissy noticed that
from the pocket of his chaps the butt of a revolver
peeped. She judged it to be the custom in Dead
Man&#8217;s Cache to go garnished with weapons.</p>
<p>Her curiosity led her to deflect toward the old
woman. But she had not taken three steps toward
the cabin before the man with the jade eyes stopped
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be near enough, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he said, civilly
enough. &#8220;This old crone has a crazy spell whenever
a stranger comes nigh. She&#8217;s nutty. It ain&#8217;t
safe to come nearer&mdash;is it, old Sit-in-the-Sun?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw grunted. Simultaneously, she looked
up, and Miss Lee thought that she had never seen
more piercing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Sit-in-the-Sun her name?&#8221; asked the girl
curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the English of it. The Navajo word is
a jawbreaker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t she understand English?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more&#8217;n you do Choctaw, miss.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quick step crunched the gravel behind Melissy.
She did not need to look around to know that here
was Black MacQueen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this&mdash;what&#8217;s this, Hank?&#8221; he demanded
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young lady started to come up and speak to
old Sit-in-the-Sun. I was just explaining to her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
how crazy the old squaw is,&#8221; Jeff answered with a
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Is that all?&#8221; MacQueen turned to Melissy.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s plumb loony&mdash;dangerous, too. I don&#8217;t
want you to go near her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s eyes flashed. &#8220;Very considerate of
you. But if you want to protect me from the really
dangerous people here, you had better send me
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you they do as I say, every man jack of
them. I&#8217;d flay one alive if he insulted you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege you don&#8217;t sublet then,&#8221; she retorted
swiftly.</p>
<p>Admiration gleamed through his amusement.
&#8220;Gad, you&#8217;ve got a sharp tongue. I&#8217;d pity the man
you marry&mdash;unless he drove with a tight rein.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re discussing, Mr. MacQueen.
Are you going to send me home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till you&#8217;ve made us a nice long visit, my
dear. You&#8217;re quite safe here. My men are plumb
gentle. They&#8217;ll eat out of your hand. They don&#8217;t
insult ladies. I&#8217;ve taught &#8217;em&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity you couldn&#8217;t teach their leader, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He acknowledged the hit. &#8220;Come again, dearie.
But what&#8217;s your complaint? Haven&#8217;t I treated you
white so far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. You insulted me grossly when you brought
me here by force.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I lay a hand on you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If it had been necessary you would have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, I would,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ve taken
a fancy to you. You&#8217;re a good-looking and a plucky
little devil. I&#8217;ve a notion to fall in love with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? Say I&#8217;m a villain and a bad lot.
Wouldn&#8217;t it be a good thing for me to tie up with
a fine, straight-up young lady like you? Me, I like
the way your eyes flash. You&#8217;ve got a devil of a
temper, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been walking toward a pile of rocks
some little way from the cluster of cabins. Now
he sat down and smiled impudently across at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my business,&#8221; she flung back stormily.</p>
<p>Genially he nodded. &#8220;So it is. Mine, too, when
we trot in double harness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her scornful eyes swept up and down him. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t marry you if you were the last man on
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Well, I&#8217;m not partial to that game myself.
I didn&#8217;t mention matrimony, did I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The meaning she read in his mocking, half-closed
eyes startled the girl. Seeing this, he added with
a shrug:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say about that. We&#8217;ll make you
Mrs. MacQueen on the level if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passion in her surged up. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather lie
dead at your feet&mdash;I&#8217;d rather starve in these hills&mdash;I&#8217;d
rather put a knife in my heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>He clapped his hands. &#8220;Fine! Fine! That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
Bernhardt woman hasn&#8217;t got a thing on you when
it comes to acting, my dear. You put that across
bully. Never saw it done better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;coward!&#8221; Her voice broke and she
turned to leave him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; The ring of the word brought her feet
to a halt. MacQueen padded across till he faced
her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make any mistake, girl. You&#8217;re mine.
I don&#8217;t care how. If it suits you to have a priest
mumble words over us, good enough. But I&#8217;m the
man you&#8217;ve got to get ready to love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good start, you little catamount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather die&mdash;a thousand times rather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you, my dear. You think you would right
now, but inside of a week you&#8217;ll be hunting for pet
names to give me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran blindly toward the house where her room
was. On the way she passed at a little distance
Dunc Boone and did not see him. His hungry eyes
followed her&mdash;a slender creature of white and russet
and gold, vivid as a hillside poppy, compact of
life and fire and grace. He, too, was a miscreant
and a villain, lost to honor and truth, but just now
she held his heart in the hollow of her tightly
clenched little fist. Good men and bad, at bottom
we are all made of the same stuff, once we are
down to the primal emotions that go deeper than
civilization&#8217;s veneer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>&#8220;TRAPPED!&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Black MacQueen rolled a cigarette and
sauntered toward the other outlaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you better saddle up and take
a look over the Flattops, Dunc. The way I figure
it Lee&#8217;s posse must be somewhere over there.
Swing around toward the Elkhorns and get back
to report by to-morrow evening, say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boone looked at him in an ugly manner. &#8220;Nothin&#8217;
doing, MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no greaser, my friend. Orders don&#8217;t go
with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t, eh? Who&#8217;s major domo of this
outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay right here in this valley to-night.
See?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; you, man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And every night so long as Melissy Lee stays.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen watched him with steady, hostile eyes.
&#8220;So it&#8217;s the girl, is it? Want to cut in, do you?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
Oh, no, my friend. Two&#8217;s company; three&#8217;s a
crowd. She&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And another thing, Mr. Boone. I don&#8217;t
stand for any interference in my plans. Make a
break at it and you&#8217;ll take a hurry up journey to
kingdom come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bank on that off chance. The boys are
with me. You&#8217;re alone. If I give the word they&#8217;ll
bump you off. <i>Don&#8217;t make a mistake, Boone.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>The Arkansan hesitated. What MacQueen said
was true enough. His overbearing disposition had
made him unpopular. He knew the others would
side against him and that if it came to a showdown
they would snuff out his life as a man does the
flame of a candle. The rage died out of his eyes
and gave place to a look of cunning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your say-so, Black. But there will be a day
when it ain&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And in the meantime you&#8217;ll ride the Flattops
when I give the word?&#8221;</p>
<p>Boone nodded sulkily. &#8220;I said you had the call,
didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ride &#8217;em now, damn you. And don&#8217;t show
up in the Cache till to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen turned on his heel and strutted away.
He was elated at his easy victory. If he had seen
the look that followed him he might not have been
so quiet in his mind.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>But on the surface he had cinched his leadership.
Boone saddled and rode out of the Cache without
another word to anybody. Sullen and vindictive he
might be, but cowed he certainly seemed. MacQueen
celebrated by frequent trips to his sleeping
quarters, where each time he resorted to a bottle
and a glass. No man had ever seen him intoxicated,
but there were times when he drank a good deal for
a few days at a stretch. His dissipation would be
followed by months of total abstinence.</p>
<p>All day the man persecuted Melissy with his attentions.
His passion was veiled under a manner
of mock deference, of insolent assurance, but as the
hours passed the fears of the girl grew upon her.
There were moments when she turned sick with
waves of dread. In the sunshine, under the open
sky, she could hold her own, but under cover of
the night&#8217;s blackness ghastly horrors would creep
toward her to destroy.</p>
<p>Nor was there anybody to whom she might turn
for help. Lane and Jackson were tools of their
leader. The Mexican woman could do nothing even
if she would. Boone alone might have helped her,
and he had ridden away to save his own skin. So
MacQueen told her to emphasize his triumph and
her helplessness.</p>
<p>To her fancy dusk fell over the valley like a pall.
It brought with it the terrible night, under cover
of which unthinkable things might be done. With
no appetite, she sat down to supper opposite her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
captor. To see him gloat over her made her heart
sink. Her courage was of no avail against the
thing that threatened.</p>
<p>Supper over, he made her sit with him on the
porch for an hour to listen to his boasts of former
conquests. And when he let her take her way to
her room it was not &#8220;Good-night&#8221; but a mocking
&#8220;Au revoir&#8221; he murmured as he bent to kiss her
hand.</p>
<p>Melissy found Rosario waiting for her, crouched
in the darkness of the room that had been given
the young woman. The Mexican spoke in her own
language, softly, with many glances of alarm to
make sure they were alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist, señorita. Here is a note. Read it. Destroy
it. Swear not to betray Rosario.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the light of a match Melissy read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Behind the big rocks. In half an hour.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A Friend.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>What could it mean? Who could have sent it?
Rosario would answer no questions. She snatched
the note, tore it into fragments, chewed them into
a pulp. Then, still shaking her head obstinately,
hurriedly left the room.</p>
<p>But at least it meant hope. Her mind flew from
her father to Jack Flatray, Bellamy, young Yarnell.
It might be any of them. Or it might be O&#8217;Connor,
who, perhaps, had by some miracle escaped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>The minutes were hours to her. Interminably
they dragged. The fear rose in her that MacQueen
might come in time to cut off her escape. At last,
in her stocking feet, carrying her shoes in her hand,
she stole into the hall, out to the porch, and from
it to the shadows of the cottonwoods.</p>
<p>It was a night of both moon and stars. She had
to cross a space washed in silvery light, taking the
chance that nobody would see her. But first she
stooped in the shadows to slip the shoes upon her
feet. Her heart beat against her side as she had
once seen that of a frightened mouse do. It seemed
impossible for her to cover all that moonlit open
unseen. Every moment she expected an alarm to
ring out in the silent night. But none came.</p>
<p>Safely she reached the big rocks. A voice called
to her softly. She answered, and came face to face
with Boone. A drawn revolver was in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made it,&#8221; he panted, as a man might who
had been running hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;But they&#8217;ll soon know.
Let us get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t come I was going in to kill him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noticed the hard glitter in his eyes as he
spoke, the crouched look of the padding tiger ready
for its kill. The man was torn with hatred and jealousy.</p>
<p>Already they were moving back through the
rocks to a dry wash that ran through the valley.
The bed of this they followed for nearly a mile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
Deflecting from it they pushed across the valley toward
what appeared to be a sheer rock wall. With
a twist to the left they swung back of a face of
rock, turned sharply to the right, and found themselves
in a fissure Melissy had not at all expected.
Here ran a little cañon known only to those few
who rode up and down it on the nefarious business
of their unwholesome lives.</p>
<p>Boone spoke harshly, breaking for the first time
in half an hour his moody silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe at last. By God, I&#8217;ve evened my score
with Black MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>And from the cliff above came the answer&mdash;a
laugh full of mocking deviltry and malice.</p>
<p>The Arkansan turned upon Melissy a startled face
of agony, in which despair and hate stood out of
a yellow pallor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his last word to her. He swept the girl
back against the shelter of the wall and ran crouching
toward the entrance.</p>
<p>A bullet zipped&mdash;a second&mdash;a third. He stumbled,
but did not fall. Turning, he came back,
dodging like a hunted fox. As he passed her, Melissy
saw that his face was ghastly. He ran with
a limp.</p>
<p>A second time she heard the cackle of laughter.
Guns cracked. Still the doomed man pushed forward.
He went down, struck in the body, but
dragged himself to his feet and staggered on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>All this time he had seen nobody at whom he
could fire. Not a shot had come from his revolver.
He sank behind a rock for shelter. The ping of
a bullet on the shale beside him brought the tortured
man to his feet. He looked wildly about him,
the moon shining on his bare head, and plunged
up the cañon.</p>
<p>And now it appeared his unseen tormentors were
afraid he might escape them. Half a dozen shots
came close together. Boone sank to the ground,
writhed like a crushed worm, and twisted over so
that his face was to the moonlight.</p>
<p>Melissy ran forward and knelt beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got me ... in half a dozen places....
I&#8217;m going fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no ... no,&#8221; the girl protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.... Surest thing you know....
I did you dirt onct, girl. And I&#8217;ve been a bad lot&mdash;a
wolf, a killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that now. You died to save me.
Always I&#8217;ll remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Onct you &#8217;most loved me.... But it
wouldn&#8217;t have done. I&#8217;m a wolf and you&#8217;re a little
white lamb. Is Flatray the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought so. Well, he&#8217;s square. I rigged it up
on him about the rustling. I was the man you liked
to &#8217;a&#8217; caught that day years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221; He broke off abruptly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
girl.... It&#8217;s gittin&#8217; black. Hold my hand till&mdash;till&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a shudder and seemed to fall together.
He was dead.</p>
<p>Melissy heard the sound of rubble slipping.
Some one was lowering himself cautiously down the
side of the cañon. A man dropped to the wash and
strutted toward her. He kept his eyes fixed on the
lifeless form, rifle ready for action at an instant&#8217;s
notice. When he reached his victim he pushed the
body with his foot, made sure of no trap, and relaxed
his alertness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead as a hammer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man was MacQueen. He turned to Melissy
and nodded jauntily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, my dear. Just taking a little
stroll?&#8221; he asked ironically.</p>
<p>The girl leaned against the cold wall and covered
her face with her arm. She was sobbing hysterically.</p>
<p>The outlaw seized her by the shoulders and
swung her round. &#8220;Cut that out, girl,&#8221; he ordered
roughly.</p>
<p>Melissy caught at her sobs and tried to check
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got what was coming to him, what he&#8217;s been
playing for a long time. I warned him, but the fool
wouldn&#8217;t see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; she asked, getting out her
question a word at a time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Knew it all the time. Rosario brought his note
to me. I told her to take it to you and keep her
mouth shut.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You planned his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you like to put it that way. Now we&#8217;ll go
home and forget this foolishness. Jeff, bring the
horses round to the mouth of the gulch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy felt suddenly very, very tired and old.
Her feet dragged like those of an Indian squaw
following her master. It was as though heavy irons
weighted her ankles.</p>
<p>MacQueen helped her to one of the horses Jackson
brought to the lip of the gulch. Weariness rode
on her shoulders all the way back. The soul of her
was crushed beneath the misfortunes that oppressed
her.</p>
<p>Long before they reached the ranch houses Rosario
came running to meet them. Plainly she was
in great excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prisoners have escaped,&#8221; she cried to MacQueen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Escaped. How?&#8221; demanded Black.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one must have helped them. I heard a
window smash and ran out. The young ranger
and another man were coming out of the last cabin
with the old man. I could do nothing. They ran.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had been talking in her own language.
MacQueen jabbed another question at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Toward the Pass.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>The outlaw ripped out an oath. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got &#8217;em.
They can&#8217;t reach it without horses as quick as we
can with them.&#8221; He whirled upon Melissy.
&#8220;March into the house, girl. Don&#8217;t you dare make
a move. I&#8217;m leaving Buck here to watch you.&#8221;
Sharply he swung to the man Lane. &#8220;Buck, if she
makes a break to get away, riddle her full of holes.
You hear me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute later, from the place where she lay face
down on the bed, Melissy heard him and his men
gallop away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>AN ESCAPE AND A CAPTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>Far up in the mountains, in that section where
head the Roaring Fork, One Horse Creek,
and the Del Oro, is a vast tract of wild, untraveled
country known vaguely as the Bad Lands.
Somewhere among the thousand and one cañons
which cleft the huddled hills lay hidden Dead Man&#8217;s
Cache. Here Black MacQueen retreated on those
rare occasions when the pursuit grew hot on his
tracks. So the current report ran.</p>
<p>Whether the abductors of Simon West were to
be found in the Cache or at some other nest in the
almost inaccessible ridges Jack Flatray had no means
of knowing. His plan was to follow the Roaring
Fork almost to its headquarters, and there establish
a base for his hunt. It might take him a week
to flush his game. It might take a month. He
clamped his bulldog jaw to see the thing out to a
finish.</p>
<p>Jack did not make the mistake of underestimating
his job. He had followed the trail of bad men
often enough to know that, in a frontier country,
no hunt is so desperate as the man-hunt. Such men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
are never easily taken, even if they do not have
all the advantage in the deadly game of hide and
seek that is played in the timber and the pockets of
the hills.</p>
<p>And here the odds all lay with the hunted. They
knew every ravine and gulch. Day by day their
scout looked down from mountain ledges to watch
the progress of the posse.</p>
<p>Moreover, Flatray could never tell at what moment
his covey might be startled from its run. The
greatest vigilance was necessary to make sure his
own party would not be ambushed. Yet slowly he
combed the arroyos and the ridges, drawing always
closer to that net of gulches in which he knew Dead
Man&#8217;s Cache must be located.</p>
<p>During the day the sheriff split his party into
couples. Bellamy and Alan McKinstra, Farnum
and Charlie Hymer, young Yarnell and the sheriff.
So Jack had divided his posse, thus leaving at the
head of each detail one old and wise head. Each
night the parties met at the rendezvous appointed
for the wranglers with the pack horses. From sunrise
to sunset often no face was seen other than
those of their own outfit. Sometimes a solitary
sheep herder was discovered at his post. Always
the work was hard, discouraging, and apparently
futile. But the young sheriff never thought of
quitting.</p>
<p>The provisions gave out. Jack sent back Hal
Yarnell and Hegler, the wrangler, to bring in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
fresh supply. Meanwhile the young sheriff took a
big chance and scouted alone. He parted from the
young Arkansan at the head of a gulch which
twisted snakelike into the mountains; Yarnell and
the pack outfit to ride to Mammoth, Flatray to dive
still deeper into the mesh of hills. He had the instinct
of the scout to stick to the high places as
much as he could. Whenever it was possible he followed
ridges, so that no spy could look down upon
him as he traveled. Sometimes the contour of the
country drove him into the open or down into hollows.
But in such places he advanced with the
swift stealth of an Indian.</p>
<p>It was on one of these occasions, when he had
been driven into a dark and narrow cañon, that he
came to a sudden halt. He was looking at an
empty tomato can. Swinging down from his saddle,
he picked it up without dismounting. A little juice
dripped from the can to the ground.</p>
<p>Flatray needed no explanation. In Arizona men
on the range often carry a can of tomatoes instead
of a water canteen. Nothing alleviates thirst like
the juice of this acid fruit. Some one had opened
this can within two hours. Otherwise the sun would
have dried the moisture.</p>
<p>Jack took his rifle from its place beneath his legs
and set it across the saddle in front of him. Very
carefully he continued on his way, watching every
rock and bush ahead of him. Here and there in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the sand were printed the signs of a horse going
in the same direction as his.</p>
<p>Up and down, in and out of a maze of crooked
paths, working by ever so devious a way higher into
the chain of mountains, Jack followed his leader.
Now he would lose the hoofmarks; now he would
pick them up again. And, at the last, they brought
him to the rim of a basin, a bowl of wooded ravines,
of twisted ridges, of bleak spurs jutting into late
pastures almost green. It was now past sunset.
Dusk was filtering down from the blue peaks. As
he looked a star peeped out low on the horizon.</p>
<p>But was it a star? He glimpsed it between trees.
The conviction grew on him that what he saw was
the light of a lamp. A tangle of rough country
lay between him and that beacon, but there before
him lay his destination. At last he had found his
way into Dead Man&#8217;s Cache.</p>
<p>The sheriff lost no time, for he knew that if he
should get lost in the darkness on one of these forest
slopes he might wander all night. A rough trail
led him down into the basin. Now he would lose
sight of the light. Half an hour later, pushing to
the summit of a hill, he might find it. After a time
there twinkled a second beside the first. He was
getting close to a settlement of some kind.</p>
<p>Below him in the darkness lay a stretch of open
meadow rising to the wooded foothills. Behind
these a wall of rugged mountains encircled the valley
like a gigantic crooked arm. Already he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
make out faintly the outlines of the huddled
buildings.</p>
<p>Slipping from his horse, Jack went forward cautiously
on foot. He was still a hundred yards from
the nearest hut when dogs bayed warning of his
approach. He waited, rifle in hand. No sign of
human life showed except the two lights shining
from as many windows. Flatray counted four other
cabins as dark as Egypt.</p>
<p>Very slowly he crept forward, always with one
eye to his retreat. Why did nobody answer the
barking of the dogs? Was he being watched all
the time? But how could he be, since he was completely
cloaked in darkness?</p>
<p>So at last he came to the nearest cabin, crept to
the window, and looked in. A man lay on a bed.
His hands and feet were securely tied and a second
rope wound round so as to bind him to the bunk.</p>
<p>Flatray tapped softly on a pane. Instantly the
head of the bound man slewed round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>The prisoner asked it ever so gently, but the sheriff
heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The top part of the window is open. You can
crawl over, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack climbed on the sill and from it through the
window. Almost before he reached the floor his
knife was out and he was slashing at the ropes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better put the light out, pardner,&#8221; suggested the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
man he was freeing, and the officer noticed that
there was no tremor in the cool, steady voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We&#8217;d make a fine mark through
the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the light went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Bucky O&#8217;Connor. Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack Flatray.&#8221;</p>
<p>They spoke together in whispers. Though both
were keyed to the highest pitch of excitement they
were as steady as eight-day clocks. O&#8217;Connor
stretched his limbs, flexing them this way and that,
so that he might have perfect control of them. He
worked especially over the forearm and fingers of
his right arm.</p>
<p>Flatray handed him a revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you&#8217;re ready, Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. It&#8217;s the cabin next to this.&#8221;</p>
<p>They climbed out of the window noiselessly and
crept to the next hut. The door was locked, the
window closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to smash the window. Nothing else
for it,&#8221; Flatray whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it. That means we&#8217;ll have to shoot
our way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the butt of his rifle the sheriff shattered the
woodwork of the window, driving the whole frame
into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; a frightened voice demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, Mr. West. Just a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>It took them scarce longer than that to free him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
and to get him into the open. A Mexican woman
came screaming out of an adjoining cabin.</p>
<p>The young men caught each an arm of the capitalist
and hurried him forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell&#8217;ll be popping in a minute,&#8221; Flatray explained.</p>
<p>But they reached the shelter of the underbrush
without a shot having been fired. Nor had a single
man appeared to dispute their escape.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like most of the family is away from
home to-night,&#8221; Bucky hazarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so, but they&#8217;re liable to drop in any minute.
We&#8217;ll keep covering ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>They circled round toward the sheriff&#8217;s horse.
As soon as they reached it West, still stiff from
want of circulation in his cramped limbs, was
boosted into the saddle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a good deal of a guess to find
our way out of the Cache,&#8221; Jack explained. &#8220;Even
in the daytime it would take a &#8217;Pache, but at night&mdash;well,
here&#8217;s hoping the luck&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found it not so good as they had hoped.
For hours they wandered in mesquit, dragged themselves
through cactus, crossed washes, and climbed
hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will never do. We&#8217;d better give it up till
daylight. We&#8217;re not getting anywhere,&#8221; the sheriff
suggested.</p>
<p>They did as he advised. As soon as a faint gray
sifted into the sky they were on the move again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
But whichever way they climbed it was always to
come up against steep cliffs too precipitous to be
scaled.</p>
<p>The ranger officer pointed to a notch beyond a
cowbacked hill. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be sure, but it looks
like that was the way they brought me into the
Cache. I could tell if I were up there. What&#8217;s the
matter with my going ahead and settling the thing?
If I&#8217;m right I&#8217;ll come back and let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack looked at West. The railroad man was
tired and drawn. He was not used to galloping
over the hills all night.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ll be here when you come back,&#8221;
Flatray said, and flung himself on the ground.</p>
<p>West followed his example.</p>
<p>It must have been half an hour later that Flatray
heard a twig snap under an approaching foot. He
had been scanning the valley with his glasses, having
given West instructions to keep a lookout in
the rear. He swung his head round sharply, and
with it his rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re covered, you fool,&#8221; cried the man who
was strutting toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop there. Not another step,&#8221; Flatray called
sharply.</p>
<p>The man stopped, his rifle half raised. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got you on every side, man.&#8221; He lifted his voice.
&#8220;Jeff&mdash;Hank&mdash;Steve! Let him know you&#8217;re alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three guns cracked and kicked up the dust close
to the sheriff.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with us?&#8221; Flatray asked,
sparring for time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop your gun. If you don&#8217;t we&#8217;ll riddle you
both.&#8221;</p>
<p>West spoke to Jack promptly. &#8220;Do as he says.
It&#8217;s MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flatray hesitated. He could kill MacQueen probably,
but almost certainly he and West would pay
the penalty. He reluctantly put his rifle down.
&#8220;All right. It&#8217;s your call.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s O&#8217;Connor?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheriff looked straight at him. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t
you enough of us for one gather?&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaws were closing in on them cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not without that smart man hunter. Where is
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We separated early this morning&mdash;thought it
would give us a better chance for a getaway.&#8221;
Jack gave a sudden exclamation of surprise. &#8220;So
it was Black MacQueen himself who posed as O&#8217;Connor
down at Mesa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Guessed it right, my friend. And I&#8217;ll tell you
one thing: you&#8217;ve made the mistake of your life
butting into Dead Man&#8217;s Cache. Your missing
friend O&#8217;Connor was due to hand in his checks to-day.
Since you&#8217;ve taken his place it will be you
that crosses the divide, Mr. Sheriff. You&#8217;d better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
tell where he is, for if we don&#8217;t get Mr. Bucky it
will be God help J. Flatray.&#8221;</p>
<p>The dapper little villain exuded a smug, complacent
cruelty. It was no use for the sheriff to remind
himself that such things weren&#8217;t done nowadays,
that the times of Geronimo and the Apache Kid
were past forever. Black MacQueen would go the
limit in deviltry if he set his mind to it.</p>
<p>Yet Flatray answered easily, without any perceptible
hesitation: &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll play my hand and
let Bucky play his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suits me if it does you. Jeff, collect that hardware.
Now, while you boys beat up the hills for
O&#8217;Connor, I&#8217;ll trail back to camp with these two
all-night picnickers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A BARGAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Melissy saw the two prisoners brought in,
though she could not tell at that distance
who they were. Her watch told her that
it was four-thirty. She had slept scarcely at all
during the night, but now she lay down on the bed
in her clothes.</p>
<p>The next she knew, Rosario was calling her to
get up for breakfast. The girl dressed and followed
Rosario to the adjoining cabin. MacQueen
was not there, and Melissy ate alone. She was given
to understand that she might walk up and down in
front of the houses for a few minutes after breakfast.
Naturally she made the most of the little liberty
allowed her.</p>
<p>The old squaw Sit-in-the-Sun squatted in front
of the last hut, her back against the log wall. The
man called Buck sat yawning on a rock a few yards
away. What struck Melissy as strange was that
the squaw was figuring on the back of an old envelope
with the stub of a lead pencil.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>The young woman walked leisurely past the cabin
for perhaps a dozen yards.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be about far enough. You don&#8217;t want
to tire yourself, Miss Lee,&#8221; Buck Lane called, with
a grin.</p>
<p>Melissy stopped, stood looking at the mountains
for a few minutes, and turned back. Sit-in-the-Sun
looked quickly at her, and at the same moment
she tore the paper in two and her fingers opened to
release one piece of the envelope upon which she
had been writing. A puff of wind carried it almost
directly in front of the girl. Lane was still yawning
sleepily, his gaze directed toward the spot where
he presently expected Rosario to step out and call
him to breakfast. Melissy dropped her handkerchief,
stooped to pick it up, and gathered at the same
time in a crumpled heap into her hand the fragment
of an envelope. Without another glance at the
squaw, the young woman kept on her way, sauntered
to the porch, and lingered there as if in doubt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; she announced to Rosario, and
turned to her rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señorita,</i>&#8221; answered her attendant quietly.</p>
<p>Once inside, Melissy lay down on her bed, with
her back to the window, and smoothed out the torn
envelope. On one side were some disjointed memoranda
which she did not understand.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>That was all, but certainly a strange puzzle for
a Navajo squaw to set her.</p>
<p>She turned the paper over, to find the other side
close-packed with writing.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Miss Lee:</p>
<p>In the last cabin but one is a prisoner,
your friend Sheriff Flatray. He is to be
shot in an hour. I have offered any sum
for his life and been refused. For God&#8217;s
sake save him somehow.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>Simon West.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Jack Flatray here, and about to be murdered!
The thing was incredible. And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash; Was
it so impossible, after all? Some one had
broken into the Cache and released the prisoners.
Who more likely than Jack to have done this? And
later they had captured him and condemned him
for what he had done.</p>
<p>Melissy reconstructed the scene in a flash. The
Indian squaw was West. He had been rigged up
in that paraphernalia to deceive any chance mountaineer
who might drop into the valley by accident.</p>
<p>No doubt, when he first saw Melissy, the railroad
magnate had been passing his time in making notes
about his plans for the system he controlled. But
when he had caught sight of her, he had written
the note, under the very eyes of the guard, had torn
the envelope as if it were of no importance, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
tossed the pieces away. He had taken the thousandth
chance that his note might fall into the hands
of the person to whom it was directed.</p>
<p>All this she understood without giving it conscious
thought. For her whole mind was filled with
the horror of what she had learned. Jack Flatray,
the man she loved, was to be killed. He was to be
shot down in an hour.</p>
<p>With the thought, she was at her door&mdash;only to
find that it had been quietly locked while she lay
on the bed. No doubt they had meant to keep her
a close prisoner until the thing they were about to
do was finished. She beat upon it, called to Rosario
to let her out, wrung her hands in her desperation.
Then she remembered the window. It was a cheap
and flimsy case, and had been jammed so that her
strength was not sufficient to raise it.</p>
<p>Her eye searched the room for a weapon, and
found an Indian tom-tom club. With this she
smashed the panes and beat down the wooden cross
bars of the sash. Agile as a forest fawn, she slipped
through the opening she had made and ran toward
the far cabin.</p>
<p>A group of men surrounded the door; and, as
she drew near, it opened to show three central figures.
MacQueen was one, Rosario Chaves a second;
but the most conspicuous was a bareheaded
young man, with his hands tied behind him. He
was going to his death, but a glance was enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
to show that he went unconquered and unconquerable.
His step did not drag. There was a faint,
grave smile on his lips; and in his eye was the dynamic
spark that proclaimed him still master of his
fate. The woolen shirt had been unbuttoned and
pulled back to make way for the rope that lay
loosely about his neck, so that she could not miss
the well-muscled slope of his fine shoulders, or the
gallant set of the small head upon the brown
throat.</p>
<p>The man who first caught sight of Melissy spoke
in a low voice to his chief. MacQueen turned his
head sharply to see her, took a dozen steps toward
her, then upbraided the Mexican woman, who had
run out after Melissy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you to lock her door&mdash;to make sure of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señor</i>&mdash;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped, and looked to
Miss Lee for an explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I broke the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw noticed then that her hand was bleeding.
&#8220;Broke the window! Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to get out! I had to stop you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He attempted no denial of what he was about to
do. &#8220;How did you know? Did Rosario tell you?&#8221;
he asked curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no! I found out&mdash;just by chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What chance?&#8221; He was plainly disconcerted
that she had come to interfere, and as plainly eager
to punish the person who had disclosed to her this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
thing, which he would have liked to do quietly,
without her knowledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that. Nobody is to blame. Say I
overheard a sentence. Thank God I did, and I am
in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no avoiding it now. He had to fight
it out with her. &#8220;In time for what?&#8221; he wanted to
know, his eyes narrowing to vicious pin points.</p>
<p>&#8220;To save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no! He must die,&#8221; cried the Mexican
woman.</p>
<p>Melissy was amazed at her vehemence, at the passion
of hate that trembled in the voice of the old
woman.</p>
<p>MacQueen nodded. &#8220;It is out of my hands, you
see. He has been condemned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her, Rosario.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman poured her story forth fluently in
the native tongue. O&#8217;Connor had killed her son&mdash;did
not deny that he had done it. And just because
Tony had tried to escape. This man had freed the
ranger. Very well. He should take O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s
place. Let him die the death. A life for a life.
Was that not fair?</p>
<p>Flatray turned his head and caught sight of Melissy.
A startled cry died on his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack!&#8221; She held out both hands to him as she
ran toward him.</p>
<p>The sheriff took her in his arms to console her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
For the girl&#8217;s face was working in a stress of emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m in time&mdash;I&#8217;m in time. Thank God I&#8217;m
in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack waited a moment to steady his voice. &#8220;How
came you here, Melissy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He brought me&mdash;Black MacQueen. I hated
him for it, but now I&#8217;m glad&mdash;so glad&mdash;because I
can save you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jack winced. He looked over her shoulder at
MacQueen, taking it all in with an air of pleasant
politeness. And one look was enough to tell him
that there was no hope for him. The outlaw had
the complacent manner of a cat which has just got
at the cream. That Melissy loved him would be
an additional reason for wiping him off the map.
And in that instant a fierce joy leaped up in Flatray
and surged through him, an emotion stronger
than the fear of death. She loved him. MacQueen
could not take that away from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a mistake,&#8221; Melissy went on eagerly.
&#8220;Of course they can&#8217;t blame you for what Lieutenant
O&#8217;Connor did. It is absurd&mdash;ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221; MacQueen tugged at his little black
mustache and kept his black eyes on her constantly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re blaming him for. The indictment
against your friend is that he interfered
when it wasn&#8217;t his business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it was his business. Don&#8217;t you know he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
sheriff? He had to do it.&#8221; Melissy turned to the
outlaw impetuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;So. And I have to play my hand out, too. It
wipes out Mr. Flatray. Sorry, but business is business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Melissy grew pale as the icy
fear gripped her heart that the man meant to go
on with the crime. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see? He&#8217;s the
sheriff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I never did love sheriffs,&#8221; drawled MacQueen.</p>
<p>The girl repeated herself helplessly. &#8220;It was his
sworn duty. That was how he looked at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>A ghost of an ironic smile flitted across the face
of the outlaw chief. &#8220;Rosario&#8217;s sworn duty is to
avenge her son&#8217;s death. That is how she looks at it.
The rest of us swore the oath with her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor had the law back of
him. This is murder!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all. It is the law of the valley&mdash;a life
for a life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The finality of it appalled her. She felt as if she
were butting her head against a stone wall. She
knew that argument and entreaty were of no avail,
yet she desperately besought first one and then another
of them to save the prisoner. Each in turn
shook his head. She could see that none of them,
save Rosario, bore him a grudge; yet none would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
move to break the valley oath. At the last, she was
through with her promises and her prayers. She
had spent them all, and had come up against the
wall of blank despair.</p>
<p>Then Jack&#8217;s grave smile thanked her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
done what you could, Melissy.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clung to him wildly. &#8220;Oh, no&mdash;no! I can&#8217;t
let you go, Jack. I can&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s got to be, dear,&#8221; he told her gently.</p>
<p>But her breaking heart could not stand that.
There must somehow be a way to save him. She
cast about desperately for one, and had not found
it when she begged the outlaw chief to see her
alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use.&#8221; He shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But just for five minutes! That can&#8217;t do any
harm, can it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And no good, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet I ask it. You might do that much for
me,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>Her despair had moved him; for he was human,
after all. That he was troubled about it annoyed
him a good deal. Her arrival on the scene had
made things unpleasant for everybody. Ungraciously
he assented, as the easiest way out of the
difficulty.</p>
<p>The two moved off to the corral. It was perhaps
thirty yards distant, and they reached it before
either of them spoke. She was the first to break
the silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t do this dreadful thing&mdash;surely, you
won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use saying another word about it. I told
you that,&#8221; he answered doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash; Oh, don&#8217;t you see? It&#8217;s one of those
things no white man can do. Once it&#8217;s done, you
have put the bars up against decency for the rest
of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll have to risk that&mdash;and down in
your heart you don&#8217;t believe it, because you think
I&#8217;ve had the bars up for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had come to an impasse already. She tried
another turn. &#8220;And you said you cared for me!
Yet you are willing to make me unhappy for the
rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no! I&#8217;m willing to make you happy.
There&#8217;s fish in the sea just as good as any that
ever were caught,&#8221; he smirked.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it would help you to free him. Don&#8217;t you
see? It&#8217;s your chance. You can begin again, now.
You can make him your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were hard and grim. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
him for a friend, and you&#8217;re dead wrong if you
think I could make this a lever to square myself
with the law. I couldn&#8217;t. He wouldn&#8217;t let me, for
one thing&mdash;he isn&#8217;t that kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you said you cared for me!&#8221; she repeated
helplessly, wringing her hands in her despair. &#8220;But
at the first chance you fail me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see it isn&#8217;t a personal matter? I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
got nothing against him&mdash;nothing to speak of. I&#8217;d
give him to you, if I could. But it&#8217;s not my say-so.
The thing is out of my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could save him, if you set yourself to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I could&mdash;if I would pay the price. But
I won&#8217;t pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. You would have to give Rosario
something&mdash;make some concession,&#8221; she said
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not willing to pay the price,&#8221; he told
her. &#8220;His life&#8217;s forfeit. Hasn&#8217;t he been hunting
us for a week?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me pay it,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I have money in
my own right&mdash;seven thousand dollars. I&#8217;ll give it
all to save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;No use. We&#8217;ve turned
down a big offer from West. Your seven thousand
isn&#8217;t a drop in the bucket.&#8221;</p>
<p>She beat her hands together wildly. &#8220;There
must be some way to save him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw was looking at her with narrowed
eyes. He saw a way, and was working it out in
his mind. &#8220;You&#8217;re willing to pay, are you?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes! All I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put his arms akimbo on the corral fence, and
looked long at her. &#8220;Suppose the price can&#8217;t be
paid in money, Miss Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money isn&#8217;t the only thing in this world. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
are lots of things it won&#8217;t buy that other things
will,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>She groped for his meaning, her wide eyes fixed
on his, and still did not find it. &#8220;Be plainer, please.
What can I do to save him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as you say. You were looking for a way,
and I suggested one. Anyhow, you&#8217;re mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted me to pay the price; but you don&#8217;t
want to pay yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it. It would be horrible!&#8221; But
she knew she could and must.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m ready to cut loose from
this way of living. When I pull off this one big
thing, I&#8217;ll quit. We&#8217;ll go somewhere and begin life
again. You said I could. Well, I will. You&#8217;ll help
me to keep straight. It won&#8217;t be only his life you
are saving. It will be mine, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t love you! How could a girl marry
a man she didn&#8217;t care for and didn&#8217;t respect?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you do both before long. I&#8217;m the
kind of man women love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the kind I hate,&#8221; she flashed bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll risk your hate, my dear,&#8221; he laughed easily.</p>
<p>She did not look at him. Her eyes were on the
horizon line, where sky and pine tops met. He knew
that she was fighting it out to a decision, and he did
not speak again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span></p>
<p>After all, she was only a girl. Right and wrong
were inextricably mixed in her mind. It was not
right to marry this man. It was not right to let
the sheriff die while she could save him. She was
generous to the core. But there was something
deeper than generosity. Her banked love for Flatray
flooded her in a great cry of protest against his
death. She loved him. She loved him. Much as
she detested this man, revolting as she found the
thought of being linked to him, the impulse to sacrifice
herself was the stronger feeling of the two.
Deep in her heart she knew that she could not let
Jack go to his death so long as it was possible to
prevent it.</p>
<p>Her grave eyes came back to MacQueen. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have to tell you one thing&mdash;I&#8217;ll hate you worse than
ever after this. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever change my
mind about that. I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He twirled his little mustache complacently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to risk that, as I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll take me to Mesa to-day. As soon as we
get there a justice of the peace will marry us. From
his house we&#8217;ll go directly to father&#8217;s. You won&#8217;t
lie to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ll play out the game square, if you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And after we&#8217;re married, what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may stay at home until I get this ransom
business settled. Then we&#8217;ll go to Sonora.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I&#8217;ll go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll trust you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s a bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without another word, they turned back to rejoin
the group by the cabin. Before they had gone
a dozen steps she stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Mr. Flatray? You will free him,
of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll take him right out due north of here,
about four miles. He&#8217;ll be blindfolded. There
we&#8217;ll leave him, with instructions how to reach
Mesa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; she announced promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To make sure that you do let him go&mdash;alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;All right. I told
you I was going to play fair. I haven&#8217;t many good
points, but that is one of them. I don&#8217;t give my
word and then break it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed angrily. &#8220;That&#8217;s your privilege.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned on him passionately. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got no
right to resent it, though I don&#8217;t care a jackstraw
whether you do or not. I&#8217;m not going into this because
I want to, but to save this man from the den
of wolves into which he has fallen. If you knew
how I despise and hate you, how my whole soul
loathes you, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t be so eager to go
on with it! You&#8217;ll get nothing out of this but the
pleasure of torturing a girl who can&#8217;t defend herself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; he answered doggedly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE PRICE</h3>
</div>

<p>MacQueen lost no time in announcing his
new program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Boys, the hanging&#8217;s off. I&#8217;ve decided
to accept West&#8217;s offer for Flatray&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s too
good to turn down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I told you all the time,&#8221; growled
Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m telling <i>you</i> now. The money will be
divided equally among you, except that Rosario will
get my share as well as hers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosario Chaves broke into fierce protests. Finding
these unheeded, she cursed the outlaws furiously
and threatened vengeance upon them. She did not
want money; she wanted this man&#8217;s life. The men
accepted this as a matter of course, and paid little
attention to the ravings of the old woman.</p>
<p>At the first news of his reprieve, Jack saw things
through a haze for a moment. But he neither broke
down nor showed undue exultation.</p>
<p>His first thought was of relief, of profound comfort;
his next of wonder and suspicion. How under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
heaven had Melissy won his life for him? He
looked quickly at her, but the eyes of the girl did
not meet his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Melissy.&#8221; Flatray spoke very gently, but something
in the way he spoke compelled the young
woman to meet his eyes.</p>
<p>Almost instantly the long lashes went down to
her pale cheeks again.</p>
<p>MacQueen cut in suavely: &#8220;I reckon this is the
time for announcements. Boys, Miss Lee has promised
to marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the stir which this produced had died
away, Flatray flashed a question: &#8220;In exchange for
my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief of the outlaws looked at him with insolence
smoldering in his black eyes. &#8220;Now, I wonder
when you ever will learn to mind your own
business, sheriff! Nobody invited you to sit into
this game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This <i>is</i> my business. I make it mine. Give me
a straight answer, Melissy. Am I right? Is it for
my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Her voice was so low he could hardly
hear it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t have it! The thing is infamous.
I can&#8217;t hide behind the skirts of a girl, least of all
you. I can die, but, by God, I&#8217;ll keep my self-respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all arranged,&#8221; Melissy answered in a
whisper.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>Flatray laughed harshly. &#8220;I guess not. You
can&#8217;t pay my debts by giving yourself to life-long
misery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right pessimistic, sheriff,&#8221; sneered MacQueen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you take me for? I won&#8217;t have it.
I won&#8217;t have it.&#8221; The sheriff&#8217;s voice was rough
and hoarse. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather die fifty times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not up to you to choose, as it happens,&#8221; the
leader of the outlaws suggested suavely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You villain! You damned white-livered coward!&#8221;
The look of the young sheriff scorched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaks right out in meeting, don&#8217;t he?&#8221; grinned
Lane.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what he is, Jack,&#8221; Melissy cried. &#8220;And
he knows I think he&#8217;s the lowest thing that crawls.
But I&#8217;ve got to save you. Don&#8217;t you see, I&#8217;ve got
to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t see it,&#8221; Flatray answered hotly.
&#8220;I can take what&#8217;s coming to me, can&#8217;t I? But if
you save my life that way you make me as low a
thing as he is. I say I&#8217;ll not have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy could stand it no longer. She began to
sob. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, Jack, I&#8217;ve got to do it. Don&#8217;t
you see? Don&#8217;t you see? <i>It won&#8217;t make any difference
with me if I don&#8217;t.</i> No difference&mdash;except
that you&#8217;ll be&mdash;dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was in his embrace, her arms around his
neck, whispering the horrible truth in his ear
brokenly. And as he felt her dear young fragrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
of hair in his nostrils, the warm, soft litheness of
her body against his, the rage and terror in him
flooded his veins. Could such things be? Was it
possible a man like that could live? Not if he could
help it.</p>
<p>Gently he unfastened her arms from his neck.
MacQueen was standing a dozen feet away, his
hands behind his back and his legs wide apart. As
Flatray swung around the outlaw read a warning
in the blazing eyes. Just as Jack tore loose from
his guards MacQueen reached for his revolver.</p>
<p>The gun flashed. A red hot blaze scorched
through Jack&#8217;s arm. Next instant MacQueen lay
flat on his back, the sheriff&#8217;s fingers tight around
his throat. If he could have had five seconds more
the man&#8217;s neck would have been broken. But they
dragged him away, fighting like a wild cat. They
flung him down and tied his hands behind him.</p>
<p>Melissy caught a glimpse of his bleeding arm,
his torn and dusty face, the appalling ferocity of
the men who were hammering him into the ground.
She took a step forward blindly. The mountains
in front of her tilted into the sky. She moved forward
another step, then stumbled and went down.
She had fainted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as well,&#8221; MacQueen nodded. &#8220;Here, Rosario,
look after the young lady. Lift Flatray to
a horse, boys, after you&#8217;ve blindfolded him. Good
enough. Oh, and one thing more, Flatray. You&#8217;re
covered by a rifle. If you lift a hand to slip that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
handkerchief from your eyes, you&#8217;re giving the signal
for Jeff to turn loose at you. We&#8217;re going to
take you away, but we don&#8217;t aim to let you out of
the Cache for a few days yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen jeered at his prisoner openly. &#8220;I
mean, Mr. Sheriff, that you&#8217;ll stay with us till the
girl does as she has promised. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, you hellhound. You&#8217;re going to hold
me against her so that she can&#8217;t change her mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly. So that she can&#8217;t rue back. You&#8217;ve
guessed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode for hours, but in what direction it was
impossible for Flatray to guess. He could tell when
they were ascending, when dropping down hill, but
in a country so rugged this meant nothing.</p>
<p>When at last he dismounted and the kerchief was
taken from his eyes he found himself in a little
pocket of the hills in front of an old log cabin.
Jeff stayed with him. The others rode away. But
not till they had him safely tied to a heavy table
leg within the hut.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>SQUIRE LATIMER TAKES A HAND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to make ready for a trip to town,
<i>señorita</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At once,&#8221; Rosario answered. &#8220;By orders of
<i>Señor</i> MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he is back?&#8221; the girl flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him I want to see him&mdash;immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to take you to him as soon as you are
ready to ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a very few minutes the young woman was
ready. Rosario led her to the cabin in front of
which she had seen the old Indian squaw. In it
were seated Simon West and Black MacQueen.
Both of them rose at her entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please take a chair, Miss Lee. We have some
business to talk over,&#8221; the outlaw suggested.</p>
<p>Melissy looked straight at him, her lips shut tight.
&#8220;What have you done with Jack Flatray?&#8221; she presently
demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Left him to find his way back to his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t hurt him ... any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you left him alone, wounded as he was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We fixed up his wound,&#8221; lied MacQueen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it very bad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A scratch. I had to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t apologize to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not apologizing, you little wild-cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want with me? Why did you
send for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to Mesa to see a parson. But before
we start there&#8217;s some business to fix up. Mr.
West and I will need your help to fix up the negotiations
for his release.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My help!&#8221; She looked at him in surprise.
&#8220;How can I help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve laid my demands before his friends. They&#8217;ll
come through with the money, sure. But I want
them to understand the conditions right plainly, so
there won&#8217;t be any mistake. What they have got
to get soaked into their heads is that, if they do
make any mistakes, they will not see Simon West
again alive. You put that up to them strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be your agent in robbing
people of their money!&#8221; she told him swiftly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand. Mr. West wants you
to do it. He wants you to explain the facts to his
friends, so they won&#8217;t act rash and get off wrong
foot first.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! If Mr. West wishes it,&#8221; she conceded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do wish it,&#8221; the great man added.</p>
<p>Though his face and hands were still stained
with the dye that had been used on them, the railroad
builder was now dressed in his own clothes.
The girl thought that he looked haggard and anxious,
and she was sure that her presence brought
him relief. In his own way he was an indomitable
fighter, but his experience had not included anything
of this nature.</p>
<p>Jack Flatray could look at death level-eyed, and
with an even pulse, because for him it was all in
the day&#8217;s work; but the prospect of it shook West&#8217;s
high-strung nerves. Nevertheless, he took command
of the explanations, because it had been his
custom for years to lead.</p>
<p>MacQueen, his sardonic smile in play, sat back
and let West do most of the talking. Both men
were working for the same end&mdash;to get the ransom
paid as soon as possible&mdash;and the multimillionaire
released; and the outlaw realized that Melissy
would coöperate the more heartily if she felt she
were working for West and not for himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Tuesday, Miss Lee. You will reach
Mesa some time to-night. My friends ought to be
on the ground already. I want you and your father
to get in touch with them right away, and arrange
the details along the line laid down by Mr. MacQueen.
In case they agree to everything and understand
fully, have the Stars and Stripes flying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
from your house all day to-morrow as a signal.
Don&#8217;t on any account omit this&mdash;because, if you do,
my captors will have to hold me longer, pending
further negotiations. I have written a letter to Mr.
Lucas, exonerating you completely, Miss Lee; and
I have ordered him to comply with all these demands
without parley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our proposition seems to Mr. West very reasonable
and fair,&#8221; grinned MacQueen impishly,
paring his finger nails.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, I think that my life is worth to
this country a good deal more than three hundred
thousand dollars,&#8221; West corrected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Besides being worth something to Simon West,&#8221;
the outlaw added carelessly.</p>
<p>West plunged into the details of delivering the
money. Once or twice the other man corrected him
or amplified some statement. In order that there
could be no mistake, a map of Sweetwater Cañon
was handed to Melissy to be used by the man who
would bring the money to the rendezvous at the
Devil&#8217;s Causeway.</p>
<p>When it came to saying good-bye, the old man
could scarce make up his mind to release the girl&#8217;s
hand. It seemed to him that she was the visible
sign of his safety, and that with her departure went
a safeguard from these desperate men. He could
not forget that she had saved the life of the sheriff,
even though he did not know what sacrifice she
had made so to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;ll do your best for me,&#8221; he said, with
tears in his eyes. &#8220;Make Lucas see this thing right.
Don&#8217;t let any fool detectives bunco him into refusing
to pay the ransom. Put it to him as strongly
as you can, that it will be either my life or the
money. I have ordered him to pay it, and I want
it paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him how it is, Mr.
West. I know it will be all right. By Thursday
afternoon we shall have you with us to dinner again.
Trust us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221; He lowered his voice and glanced at
MacQueen, who had been called aside to speak to
one of his men. &#8220;And I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re going away
from here. This is no place for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t quite the place for you, either,&#8221; she answered,
with a faint, joyless smile.</p>
<p>They started an hour before midday. Rosario
had packed a lunch for both of them in MacQueen&#8217;s
saddlebags, for it was the intention of the latter to
avoid ranches and traveled trails on the way down.
He believed that the girl would go through with
what she had pledged herself to do, but he did not
mean to take chances of a rescue.</p>
<p>In the middle of the afternoon they stopped for
lunch at Round-up Spring&mdash;a water hole which had
not dried up in a dozen years. It was a somber
meal. Melissy&#8217;s spirits had been sinking lower and
lower with every mile that brought her nearer the
destiny into which this man was forcing her. Food
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
choked her, and she ate but little. Occasionally,
with staring eyes, she would fall into a reverie,
from which his least word would startle her to a
shiver of apprehension. This she always controlled
after the first instinctive shudder.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, girl? I&#8217;m not going
to hurt you any. I never hit a woman in my life,&#8221;
the man said once roughly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may, after you&#8217;re married. It&#8217;s
usually one&#8217;s wife one beats. Don&#8217;t be discouraged.
You&#8217;ll have the experience yet,&#8221; she retorted, but
without much spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;To hear you tell it, I&#8217;m a devil through and
through! It&#8217;s that kind of talk that drives a man
to drink,&#8221; he flung out angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to wife beating. Of course, I&#8217;m not your
chattel yet, because the ceremony hasn&#8217;t been read;
but if you would like to anticipate a few hours and
beat me, I don&#8217;t suppose there is any reason you
shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gad! How you hate me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her inveteracy discouraged him. His good looks,
his debonair manner, the magnetic charm he knew
how to exert&mdash;these, which had availed him with
other women, did not seem to reach her at all. She
really gave him no chance to prove himself. He
was ready to be grave or gay&mdash;to be a light-hearted
boy or a blasé man of the world&mdash;to adopt any rôle
that would suit her. But how could one play up
effectively to a chill silence which took no note of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
him, to a depression of the soul which would not
let itself be lifted? He felt that she was living up
to the barest letter of the law in fulfilling their contract,
and because of it he steeled himself against
her sufferings.</p>
<p>There was one moment of their ride when she
stood on the tiptoe of expectation and showed again
the sparkle of eager life. MacQueen had resaddled
after their luncheon, and they were climbing a long
sidehill that looked over a dry valley. With a gesture,
the outlaw checked her horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some quarter of a mile from them two men were
riding up a wash that ran through the valley. The
mesquite and the cactus were thick, and it was for
only an occasional moment that they could be seen.
Black and the girl were screened from view by a
live oak in front of them, so that there was no danger
of being observed. The outlaw got out his field
glasses and watched the men intently.</p>
<p>Melissy could not contain the question that trembled
on her lips: &#8220;Do you know them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I look&mdash;please?&#8221;</p>
<p>He handed her the glasses. She had to wait for
the riders to reappear, but when they did she gave
a little cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Mr. Bellamy!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her steadily, ready to crush in her
throat any call she might utter for help. But he
soon saw that she had no intention of making her
presence known. Her eyes were glued to the glasses.
As long as the men were in sight she focused her
gaze on them ravenously. At last a bend in the
dry river bed hid them from view. She lowered the
binoculars with a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lucky they didn&#8217;t see us,&#8221; he said, with his easy,
sinister laugh. &#8220;Lucky for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noticed for the first time that he had uncased
his rifle and was holding it across the saddle-tree.</p>
<p>Night slipped silently down from the hills&mdash;the
soft, cool, velvet night of the Arizona uplands. The
girl drooped in the saddle from sheer exhaustion.
The past few days had been hard ones, and last
night she had lost most of her sleep. She had ridden
far on rough trails, had been subjected to a
stress of emotion to which her placid maiden life
had been unused. But she made no complaint. It
was part of the creed she had unconsciously learned
from her father to game out whatever had to be
endured.</p>
<p>The outlaw, though he saw her fatigue, would
not heed it. She had chosen to set herself apart
from him. Let her ask him to stop and rest, if she
wanted to. It would do her pride good to be humbled.
Yet in his heart he admired her the more,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
because she asked no favors of him and forbore the
womanish appeal of tears.</p>
<p>His watch showed eleven o&#8217;clock by the moon
when the lights of Mesa glimmered in the valley
below.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in now in half an hour,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She had no comment to make, and silence fell
between them again until they reached the outskirts
of the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get off here and walk in,&#8221; he ordered;
and, after she had dismounted, he picketed the
horses close to the road. &#8220;You can send for yours
in the mornin&#8217;. Mine will be in the livery barn
by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The streets were practically deserted in the residential
part of the town. Only one man they saw,
and at his approach MacQueen drew Melissy behind
a large lilac bush.</p>
<p>As the man drew near the outlaw&#8217;s hand tightened
on the shoulder of the girl. For the man was
her father&mdash;dusty, hollow-eyed, and haggard. The
two crouching behind the lilacs knew that this iron
man was broken by his fears for his only child, the
girl who was the apple of his eye.</p>
<p>Not until he was out of hearing did Melissy open
her lips to the stifled cry she had suppressed. Her
arms went out to him, and the tears rolled down
her cheeks. For herself she had not let herself
break down, but for her father&#8217;s grief her heart
was like water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Don&#8217;t break down now. You&#8217;ll be
with him inside of half an hour,&#8221; the outlaw told
her gruffly.</p>
<p>They stopped at a house not much farther down
the street, and he rang the bell. It took a second
ring to bring a head out of the open window upstairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; a sleepy voice demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Squire Latimer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down. We want to get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why can&#8217;t you come at a reasonable hour?&mdash;consarn
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind that. There&#8217;s a good fee in it.
Hurry up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently the door opened. &#8220;Come in. You can
wait in the hall till I get a light.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I don&#8217;t want a light. We&#8217;ll step into this
room, and be married at once,&#8221; MacQueen told him
crisply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that. I&#8217;m not marrying
folks that can&#8217;t be looked at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll marry us, and at once. I&#8217;m Black MacQueen!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was ludicrous to see how the justice of the
peace fell back in terror before the redoubtable bad
man of the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know as a light is a legal necessity;
but we got to have witnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any in the house?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter and a girl friend of hers are sleeping
upstairs. I&#8217;ll call them, Mr. Black&mdash;er&mdash;I
mean Mr. MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw went with the squire to the foot of
the stairs, whence Latimer wakened the girls and
told them to dress at once, as quickly as possible.
A few minutes later they came down&mdash;towsled, eyes
heavy with sleep, giggling at each other in girlish
fashion. But when they knew whose marriage they
were witnessing, giggles and sleep fled together.</p>
<p>They were due for another surprise later. MacQueen
and his bride were standing in the heavy
shadows, so that both bulked vaguely in mere outline.
Hitherto, Melissy had not spoken a word.
The time came when it was necessary for the justice
to know the name of the girl whom he was
marrying. Her answer came at once, in a low,
scarcely audible voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Melissy Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>An electric shock could scarce have startled them
more. Of all the girls in Mesa none was so proud
as Melissy Lee, none had been so far above criticism,
such a queen in the frontier town. She had
spent a year in school at Denver; she had always
been a social leader. While she had always been
friendly to the other girls, they had looked upon
her with a touch of awe. She had all the things
they craved, from beauty to money. And now she
was marrying at midnight, in the dark, the most
notorious bad man of Arizona!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>Here was a wonder of wonders to tell the other
girls to-morrow. The only pity was that they could
not see her face&mdash;and his. They had heard that
he was handsome. No doubt that accounted for it.
And what could be more romantic than a love match
with such a fascinating villain? Probably he had
stormed her heart irresistibly.</p>
<p>The service proceeded. The responses of the
man came clearly and triumphantly, those of the
girl low but distinctly. It was the custom of the
justice to join the hands of the parties he was marrying;
but when he moved to do so this girl put both
of hers quickly behind her. It was his custom also
to kiss the bride after pronouncing them man and
wife; but he omitted this, too, on the present occasion.
Nor did the groom kiss her.</p>
<p>The voice of the justice died away. They stood
before him man and wife. The witnesses craned
forward to see the outlaw embrace his bride. Instead,
he reached into his pocket and handed Latimer
a bill. The denomination of it was one hundred
dollars, but the justice did not discover that
until later.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that squares us,&#8221; the bad man said unsentimentally.
&#8220;Now, all of you back to bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen and his bride passed out into the night.
The girls noticed that she did not take his arm;
that she even drew back, as if to avoid touching
him as they crossed the threshold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>Not until they reached the gate of her father&#8217;s
house did MacQueen speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not all coyote, girl. I&#8217;ll give you the three
days I promised you. After that you&#8217;ll join me
wherever I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered without spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll stand pat to our agreement. When they
try to talk you out of it you won&#8217;t give in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was deadly weary, could scarce hold up her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you lie to me I&#8217;ll take it out on your folks.
Don&#8217;t forget that Jack Flatray will have to pay if
you double-cross me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to pay in full.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&#8217;ll capture him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean we won&#8217;t have to do that. We haven&#8217;t
turned him loose yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you lied to me?&#8221; She stared at him with
wide open eyes of horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to keep him to make sure of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her groan touched his vanity, or was it perhaps
his pity?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to hurt him&mdash;if you play fair.
I tell you I&#8217;m no cur. Help me, girl, and I&#8217;ll quit
this hell raising and live decent.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed without joy, bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you think,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t blame you. But what do you know about my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
life? What do you know about what I&#8217;ve had to
fight against? All my life there has been some devil
in me, strangling all the good. There has been nobody
to give me a helping hand&mdash;none to hold me
back. I was a dog with a bad name&mdash;good enough
for hanging, and nothing else.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was holding the gate, and perforce she had
to hear him out.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I care about that?&#8221; she cried, in a
fierce gust of passion. &#8220;I see you are cur and coward!
You lied to me. You didn&#8217;t keep faith and
free Jack Flatray. That is enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was the one person in the world who had
power to wound him. Nor did it hurt the less that
it was the truth. He drew back as if the lash of a
whip had swept across his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;No man alive can say that to me and live!&#8221; he
told her. &#8220;Cur I may be; but you&#8217;re my wife,
&#8217;Lissie MacQueen. Don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go! Go!&#8221; she choked. &#8220;I hope to God I&#8217;ll
never see your face again!&#8221;</p>
<p>She flew along the grass-bordered walk, whipped
open the front door, and disappeared within. She
turned the key in the lock, and stood trembling in
the darkness. She half expected him to follow, to
attempt to regain possession of her.</p>
<p>But the creak of his quick step on the porch did
not come. Only her hammering heart stirred in
the black silence. She drew a long breath of relief,
and sank down on the stairs. It was over at last,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
the horrible nightmare through which she had been
living.</p>
<p>Gradually she fought down her fears and took
hold of herself. She must find her father and relieve
his anxiety. Quietly she opened the door of
the hall into the living room.</p>
<p>A man sat at the table, with his back to her, in
an attitude of utter dejection. He was leaning forward,
with his head buried in his arms. It was her
father. She stepped forward, and put her hands
on his bowed shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy,&#8221; she said softly.</p>
<p>At her touch the haggard, hopeless, unshaven face
was lifted toward her. For a moment Lee looked at
her as if she had been a wraith. Then, with a
hoarse cry, he arose and caught her in his arms.</p>
<p>Neither of them could speak for emotion. He
tried it twice before he could get out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby! Honey!&#8221;</p>
<p>He choked back the sobs in his throat. &#8220;Where
did you come from? I thought sure MacQueen had
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He had. He took me to Dead Man&#8217;s Cache
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you escaped. Praise the Lord, honey!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;he brought me back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;MacQueen did! Goddlemighty&mdash;he knows
what&#8217;s best for him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He brought me back to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She broke
down, and buried her head in his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>Long, dry sobs racked her. The father divined
with alarm that he did not know the worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me&mdash;tell me, &#8217;Lissie! Brought you back
to do what, honey?&#8221; He held her back from him,
his hands on her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;To marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To marry me. And he did&mdash;fifteen minutes ago,
I am Black MacQueen&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black MacQueen&#8217;s wife! My God, girl!&#8221; Big
Beauchamp Lee stared at her in a horror of incredulity.</p>
<p>She told him the whole story, from beginning
to end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE TAKING OF THE CACHE</h3>
</div>

<p>It was understood that in the absence of the
sheriff Richard Bellamy should have charge
of the posse, and after the disappearance of
Flatray he took command.</p>
<p>With the passing years Bellamy had become a
larger figure in the community. The Monte Cristo
mine had made him independently wealthy, even
though he had deeded one-third of it to Melissy
Lee. Arizona had forgiven him his experiment at
importing sheep and he was being spoken of as a
territorial delegate to Congress, a place the mine
owner by no means wanted. For his interests were
now bound up in the Southwest. His home was
there. Already a little toddler&#8217;s soft fat fist was
clinging to the skirt of Ferne.</p>
<p>At first Bellamy, as well as Farnum, McKinstra,
young Yarnell and the rest of the posse looked expectantly
for the return of the sheriff. It was hard
to believe that one so virile, so competent, so much
a dominant factor of every situation he confronted,
could have fallen a victim to the men he hunted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
But as the days passed with no news of him the
conviction grew that he had been waylaid and shot.
The hunt went on, but the rule now was that no
move should be made singly. Not even for an hour
did the couples separate.</p>
<p>One evening a woman drifted into camp just as
they were getting ready to roll into their blankets.
McKinstra was on sentry duty, but she got by him
unobserved and startled Farnum into drawing his
gun.</p>
<p>Yet all she said was: &#8220;<i>Buenos tardes, señor</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman was a wrinkled Mexican with a close-shut,
bitter mouth and bright, snappy eyes.</p>
<p>Farnum stared at her in surprise. &#8220;Who in Arizona
are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was decidedly disturbing to think what might
have happened if MacQueen&#8217;s outfit had dropped
in on them, instead of one lone old woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosario Chaves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, ma&#8217;am. Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>The others had by this time gathered around.</p>
<p>Rosario spoke in Spanish, and Bob Farnum answered
in the same language. &#8220;You want to find
the way into Dead Man&#8217;s Cache, señor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we? I reckon yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me be your guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the way in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Connected with MacQueen&#8217;s outfit, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cook for him. My son was one of his men.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He was killed&mdash;shot by Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor,
the same man who was a prisoner at the Cache
until yesterday morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killed lately, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago. We swore revenge. MacQueen
did not keep his oath, the oath we all swore together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bellamy began to understand the situation. She
wanted to get back at MacQueen, unless she were
trying to lead them into a trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get this straight. MacQueen turned
O&#8217;Connor loose, did he?&#8221; Bellamy questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. He escaped. This man&mdash;what you call
him?&mdash;the sheriff, helped him and Señor West to
break away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mine owner&#8217;s eye met Farnum&#8217;s. They
were being told much news.</p>
<p>&#8220;So they all escaped, did they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señor</i>, but MacQueen took West and the
sheriff next morning. They could not find their
way out of the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But O&#8217;Connor escaped. Is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed hatred. &#8220;He escaped because
the sheriff helped him. His life was forfeit to me.
So then was the sheriff&#8217;s. MacQueen he admit it.
But when the girl promise to marry him he speak
different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Señorita</i> Lee.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not Melissy Lee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Si, señor</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God! Melissy Lee a prisoner of that infernal
villain. How did she come there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mexican woman was surprised at the sudden
change that had come over the men. They
had grown tense and alert. Interest had flamed
into a passionate eagerness.</p>
<p>Rosario Chaves told the story from beginning
to end, so far as she knew it; and every sentence
of it wrung the big heart of these men. The pathos
of it hit them hard. Their little comrade, the girl
they had been fond of for years&mdash;the bravest, truest
lass in Arizona&mdash;had fallen a victim to this intolerable
fate! They could have wept with the agony
of it if they had known how.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure they were married? Maybe the
thing slipped up,&#8221; Alan suggested, the hope father
to the thought.</p>
<p>But this hope was denied him; for the woman
had brought with her a copy of the Mesa <i>Sentinel</i>,
with an account of the marriage and the reason for
it. This had been issued on the morning after the
event, and MacQueen had brought it back with him
to the Cache.</p>
<p>Bellamy arranged with the Mexican woman a
plan of attack upon the valley. Camp was struck
at once, and she guided them through tortuous
ravines and gulches deeper into the Roaring Fork
country. She left them in a grove of aspens, just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
above the lip of the valley, on the side least frequented
by the outlaws.</p>
<p>They were to lie low until they should receive
from her a signal that most of the gang had left
to take West to the place appointed for the exchange.
They were then to wait through the day
until dusk, slip quietly down, and capture the ranch
before the return of the party with the gold. In
case anything should occur to delay the attack on
the ranch, another signal was to be given by Rosario.</p>
<p>The first signal was to be the hanging of washing
upon the line. If this should be removed before
nightfall, Bellamy was to wait until he should hear
from her again.</p>
<p>Bellamy believed that the Chaves woman was
playing square with him, but he preferred to take
no chances. As soon as she had left to return to
the settlement of the outlaws he moved camp again
to a point almost half a mile from the place where
she had last seen them. If the whole thing were a
&#8220;plant,&#8221; and a night attack had been planned, he
wanted to be where he and his men could ambush
the ambushers, if necessary.</p>
<p>But the night passed without any alarm. As the
morning wore away the scheduled washing appeared
on the line. Farnum crept down to the valley lip
and trained his glasses on the ranch house. Occasionally
he could discern somebody moving about,
though there were not enough signs of activity to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
show the presence of many people. All day the
wash hung drying on the line. Dusk came, the
blankets still signaling that all was well.</p>
<p>Bellamy led his men forward under cover, following
the wooded ridge above the Cache so long
as there was light enough by which they might be
observed from the valley. With the growing darkness
he began the descent into the bowl just behind
the corral. A light shone in the larger cabin; and
Bellamy knew that, unless Rosario were playing him
false, the men would be at supper there. He left
his men lying down behind the corral, while he crept
forward to the window from which the light was
coming.</p>
<p>In the room were two men and the Mexican
woman. The men, with elbows far apart, and knives
and forks very busy, were giving strict attention
to the business in hand. Rosario waited upon them,
but with ear and eye guiltily alert to catch the least
sound. The mine owner could even overhear fragments
of the talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought to get back by midnight, don&#8217;t you
reckon? Pass the cow and the sugar, Buck. Keep
a-coming with that coffee, Rosario. I ain&#8217;t a mite
afraid but what MacQueen will pull it off all right,
you bet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, he will. Give that molasses a shove,
Tom&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bellamy drew his revolver and slipped around to
the front door. He came in so quietly that neither
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
of the men heard him. Both had their backs to
the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Figure it up, and it makes a right good week&#8217;s
work. I reckon I&#8217;ll go down to Chihuahua and
break the bank at Miguel&#8217;s,&#8221; one of them was
saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better go to Yuma and break stones for a spell,
Buck,&#8221; suggested a voice from the doorway.</p>
<p>Both men slewed their heads around as if they
had been worked by the same lever. Their mouths
opened, and their eyes bulged. A shining revolver
covered them competently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t you, Buck&mdash;nor you either, Tom!&#8221;
This advice because of a tentative movement each
had made with his right hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m awful careless
about spilling lead, when I get excited. Better
reach for the roof; then you won&#8217;t have any temptations
to suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hard eyes of the outlaws swept swiftly over
the cattleman. Had he shown any sign of indecision,
they would have taken a chance and shot it
out. But he was so easily master of himself that
the impulse to &#8220;draw&#8221; died stillborn.</p>
<p>Bellamy gave a sharp, shrill whistle. Footsteps
came pounding across the open, and three armed
men showed at the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn my skin if the old son of a gun hasn&#8217;t
hogged all the glory!&#8221; Bob Farnum complained
joyfully. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you introduce us to your friends,
Bellamy?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman with the biscuit in his hand is
Buck; the one so partial to porterhouse steak is
Tom,&#8221; returned Bellamy gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to death to meet you, gents. Your hands
seem so busy drilling for the ceiling, we won&#8217;t shake
right now. If it would be any kindness to you, I&#8217;ll
unload all this hardware, though. My! You tote
enough with you to start a store, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you find your way in?&#8221; growled Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest drifted in on our automobiles and airships,&#8221;
Bob told him airily, as he unbuckled the revolver
belt and handed it to one of his friends.</p>
<p>The outlaws were bound, after which Rosario
cooked the posse a dinner. This was eaten voraciously
by all, for camp life had sharpened the appetite
for a woman&#8217;s cooking.</p>
<p>One of the men kept watch to notify them when
MacQueen and his gang should enter the valley,
while the others played &#8220;pitch&#8221; to pass the time.
In spite of this, the hours dragged. It was a good
deal like waiting for a battle to begin. Bellamy and
Farnum had no nerves, but the others became nervous
and anxious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon something is keeping them,&#8221; suggested
Alan, after looking at his watch for the fifth time
in half an hour. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you reckon we better go
up the trail a bit to meet them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we better wait here, Alan. Bid three,&#8221;
returned Farnum evenly.</p>
<p>As he spoke, their scout came running in.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re here, boys!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough! How many of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four of &#8217;em, looked like. They were winding
down the trail, and I couldn&#8217;t make out how many.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, boys. Steady, now, till they get down
from their horses. Hal, out with the light when I
give the word.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a minute to shake nerves of steel. They
could hear the sound of voices, an echo of jubilant
laughter, the sound of iron shoes striking stones in
the trail. Then some one shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you, Buck!&#8221;</p>
<p>The program might have gone through as arranged,
but for an unlooked-for factor in the proceedings.
Buck let out a shout of warning to his
trapped friends. Almost at the same instant the
butt of Farnum&#8217;s revolver smashed down on his
head; but the damage was already done.</p>
<p>Bellamy and his friends swarmed out like bees.
The outlaws were waiting irresolutely&mdash;some
mounted, others beside their horses. Among them
were two pack horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; ordered the mine owner sharply.</p>
<p>The answer was a streak of fire from a rifle. Instantly
there followed a fusillade. Flash after flash
lit up the darkness. Staccato oaths, cries, a moan
of pain, the trampling of frightened horses, filled
the night with confusion.</p>
<p>In spite of the shout of warning, the situation
had come upon the bandits as a complete surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
How many were against them, whether or not they
were betrayed, the certainty that the law had at
last taken them at a disadvantage&mdash;these things
worked with the darkness for the posse. A man
flung himself on his pony, lay low on its back, and
galloped wildly into the night. A second wheeled
and followed at his heels. Hank Irwin was down,
with a bullet from a carbine through his jaw and
the back of his head. A wild shot had brought
down another. Of the outlaws only MacQueen,
standing behind his horse as he fired, remained on
the field uninjured.</p>
<p>The cattlemen had scattered as the firing began,
and had availed themselves of such cover as was
to be had. Now they concentrated their fire on the
leader of the outlaws. His horse staggered and
went down, badly torn by a rifle bullet. A moment
later the special thirty-two carbine he carried was
knocked from his hands by another shot.</p>
<p>He crouched and ran to Irwin&#8217;s horse, flung himself
to the saddle, deliberately emptied his revolver
at his foes, and put spurs to the broncho. As he
vanished into the hills Bob Farnum slowly sank to
the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got mine, Bellamy. Blamed if he ain&#8217;t
plumb bust my laig!&#8221;</p>
<p>The mine owner covered the two wounded outlaws,
while his men disarmed them. Then he walked
across to his friend, laid down his rifle, and knelt
beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get you bad, old man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad enough so I reckon I&#8217;ll have a doc look at
it one of these days.&#8221; Bob grinned to keep down
the pain.</p>
<p>Once more there came the sound of hoofs beating
the trail of decomposed granite. Bellamy looked
up and grasped his rifle. A single rider loomed out
of the darkness and dragged his horse to a halt, a
dozen yards from the mine owner, in such a position
that he was directly behind one of the pack
horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up with your hands!&#8221; ordered Bellamy on suspicion.</p>
<p>Two hands went swiftly up from beside the saddle.
The moonlight gleamed on something bright
in the right hand. A flash rent the night. A jagged,
red-hot pain tore through the shoulder of Hal Yarnell.
He fired wildly, the shock having spoiled his
aim.</p>
<p>The attacker laughed exultantly, mockingly, as
he swung his horse about.</p>
<p>&#8220;A present from Black MacQueen,&#8221; he jeered.</p>
<p>With that, he was gone again, taking the pack
animal with him. He had had the audacity to come
back after his loot&mdash;and had got some of it, too.</p>
<p>One of the unwounded cowpunchers gave pursuit,
but half an hour later he returned ruefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lost him somehow&mdash;darned if I know how. I
seen him before me one minute; the next he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
gone. Must &#8217;a&#8217; known some trail that led off from
the road, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bellamy said nothing. He intended to take up
the trail in person; but first the wounded had to be
looked to, a man dispatched for a doctor, and things
made safe against another possible but improbable
attack. It was to be a busy night; for he had on
hand three wounded men, as well as two prisoners
who were sound. An examination showed him that
neither of the two wounded outlaws nor Farnum
nor Yarnell were fatally shot. All were hardy outdoors
men, who had lived in the balsamic air of
the hills; if complications did not ensue, they would
recover beyond question.</p>
<p>In this extremity Rosario was a first aid to the
injured. She had betrayed the bandits without the
least compunction, because they had ignored the oath
of vengeance against the slayer of her son; but she
nursed them all impartially and skillfully until the
doctor arrived, late next day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Bellamy and McKinstra, guided by
one of the outlaws, surprised Jeff and released Flatray,
who returned with them to camp.</p>
<p>With the doctor had come also four members of
the Lee posse. To the deputy in charge Jack turned
over his four prisoners and the gold recovered.
As soon as the doctor had examined and dressed
his wound he mounted and took the trail after MacQueen.
With him rode Bellamy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>MELISSY ENTERTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>The notes of Schumann&#8217;s &#8220;Traümerei&#8221; died
away. Melissy glanced over her music,
and presently ran lightly into Chopin&#8217;s
&#8220;Valse Au Petit Chien.&#8221; She was, after all, only
a girl; and there were moments when she forgot
to remember that she was wedded to the worst
of unhanged villains. When she drowned herself
fathoms deep in her music, she had the best chance
of forgetting.</p>
<p>Chaminade&#8217;s &#8220;The Flatterer&#8221; followed. In the
midst of this the door opened quietly and closed
again. Melissy finished, fingered her music, and
became somehow aware that she was not alone. She
turned unhurriedly on the seat and met the smiling
eyes of her husband.</p>
<p>From his high-heeled boots to his black, glossy
hair, Black MacQueen was dusty with travel. Beside
him was a gunny sack, tied in the middle and
filled at both ends. Picturesque he was and always
would be, but his present costume scarce fitted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
presence of a lady. Yet of this he gave no sign.
He was leaning back in a morris chair, rakish,
debonair, and at his ease. Evidently, he had been
giving appreciative ear to the music, and more appreciative
eye to the musician.</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s you,&#8221; said Melissy, white to the lips.</p>
<p>MacQueen arose, recovered his dusty hat from
the floor, and bowed theatrically. &#8220;Your long-lost
husband, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m visiting my wife. The explanation seems
a trifle obvious.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I said I wanted anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better leave. I&#8217;ll give you up if
I get a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her with lazy derision. &#8220;I like
you angry. Your eyes snap electricity, sweet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She gave a gesture of impatience. &#8220;Do
you know that, if I were to step to that window
and call out your name, the whole town would be
in arms against you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall, if you don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you alone in the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you ask?&#8221; Her heart was beating fast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you must hide me till night. Is your
father here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now. He is hunting you&mdash;to kill you if he
finds you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Servants?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cook is out for the afternoon. She will be
back in an hour or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Get me food.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not rise. &#8220;I must know more. What is
it? Are they hunting you? What have you done
now?&#8221; A strong suppressed excitement beat in her
pulses.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not what I have done, but what your friends
have done. Yesterday I went to exchange West
for the ransom money. Most of my men I had to
take with me, to guard against foul play. We held
the cañon from the flat tops, and everything went
all right. The exchange was made. We took the
ransom money back to the Cache. I don&#8217;t know
how it was&mdash;whether somebody played me false and
sold us, or whether your friend Flatray got loose
and his posse stumbled in by accident. But there
they were in the Cache when we got back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; The keenest agitation was in Melissy&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They took us by surprise. We fought. Two
of my men ran away. Two were shot down. I
was alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>The devil of torment moved in him. &#8220;Then I
shot up one of your friend&#8217;s outfit, rode away,
changed my mind, and went back, shot your friend,
and hiked off into the hills with a pack horse loaded
with gold.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span></p>
<p>Out of all this one thing stood out terribly to
her. &#8220;You shot Jack Flatray&mdash;again!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed. One lie more or less made no difference.
&#8220;I sure did.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had to moisten her lips before she could ask
the next question: &#8220;You&mdash;killed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;worse luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He and another man were on the trail after me
to-day. I saw them pass up Moose Creek from a
ledge on which I was lying. If I had had a rifle,
I would have finished the job; but my carbine was
gone. It was too far for a six-gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if you wounded him last night, how could
he be trailing you to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon it was a flesh wound. His shoulder
was tied up, I noticed.&#8221; Impatiently he waved
Flatray out of the conversation. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t come
here to tell you about him. I got to get out on tonight&#8217;s
train. This country has grown too hot for
me. You&#8217;re going with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, by God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never go with you&mdash;never&mdash;never!&#8221; she
cried passionately. &#8220;I&#8217;m free of the bargain. You
broke faith. So shall I.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw his jaw clamp. &#8220;So you&#8217;re going to
throw me down, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy stood before him, slim and straight, without
yielding an inch. She was quite colorless, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
he was a man with whose impulses she could not
reckon. But one thing she knew. He could never
take her away with him and escape. And she knew
that he must know it, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to call it that. You tricked me
into marrying you. You meant to betray me all
the time. Go, while there&#8217;s still a chance. I don&#8217;t
want your blood on my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was characteristic of him that he always wanted
more what he could not get.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t answer so quick, girl. Listen to me.
I&#8217;ve got enough in that sack to start us in the cattle
business in Argentina. There&#8217;s more buried in
the hills, if we need it. Girl, I tell you I&#8217;m going
to run straight from to-day!&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully. &#8220;And in the same
breath you tell me how much you have stolen and
are taking with you. If you were a Cr&oelig;sus, I
wouldn&#8217;t go with you.&#8221; She flamed into sudden,
fierce passion. &#8220;Will you never understand that I
hate and detest you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think you do, but you don&#8217;t. You love me&mdash;only
you won&#8217;t let yourself believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no arguing with such colossal conceit,&#8221;
she retorted, with hard laughter. &#8220;It&#8217;s no use to
tell you that I should like to see you dead at my
feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Swiftly he slid a revolver from its holster, and
presented it to her, butt first. &#8220;You can have your
wish right easy, if you mean it. Go to it. There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
no danger. All you&#8217;ve got to give out is that I
frightened you. You&#8217;ll be a heroine, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at the weapon and at him, and the
very thought of it made her sick. She saw the
thing almost as if it were already done&mdash;the smoking
revolver in her hand, and the man lying motionless
before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it away,&#8221; she said, with a shudder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, you can&#8217;t do it! You can&#8217;t even go
to the window there and shout out that Black MacQueen
is with you in the house. You don&#8217;t hate
me at all, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I won&#8217;t kill you with my own hand?
You reason logically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you betray my presence? Why
don&#8217;t you call your friends in to take me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure that I won&#8217;t; but if I don&#8217;t, it will
be for their sakes, and not for yours. They could
not take you without loss of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; he agreed, with a flash of
his tigerish ferocity. &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t take me alive
at all, and I reckon before I checked in a few of
them would.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>BLACK MACQUEEN CASHES HIS CHECKS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was part of his supreme audacity to trust
her. While he was changing his dusty, travel-stained
clothes for some that belonged to her
brother she prepared a meal for him downstairs.
A dozen times the impulse was on her to fly into
the street and call out that Black MacQueen was
in the house, but always she restrained herself. He
was going to leave the country within a few hours.
Better let him go without bloodshed.</p>
<p>He came down to his dinner fresh from a bath
and a shave, wearing a new tweed suit, which fitted
him a trifle loosely, but was not unbecoming to his
trim, lithe figure. No commercial traveler at a
familiar hotel could have been more jauntily and
blithely at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t run away!&#8221; He grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. I&#8217;m going to later. I owe you a meal,
and I wanted to pay it first.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was his very contempt of fear that had held
her. To fool away half an hour in dressing, knowing
that it was very likely she might be summoning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
men to kill him&mdash;to come down confident and unperturbed,
possibly to meet his death&mdash;was such a
piece of dare-deviltry as won reluctant admiration,
in spite of her detestation of him. Even if she did
not give him up, his situation was precarious in the
extreme. All the trains were being watched; and
in spite of this he had to walk boldly to the station,
buy a ticket, and pass himself off for an ordinary
traveler.</p>
<p>Both knew that the chances were against him,
but he gave no sign of concern or anxiety. Never
had Melissy seen him so full of spirits. The situation
would have depressed most men; him it merely
stimulated. The excitement of it ran like wine
through his blood. Driven from his hills, with
every man&#8217;s hand against him, with the avenues
of escape apparently closed, he was in his glory.
He would play his cards out to the end, without
whining, no matter how the game might go.</p>
<p>Melissy washed the dishes, in order that the cook
might not know that she had had a guest for luncheon.
The two returned to the living room. It was
his whim to have her play for him; and she was
glad to comply, because it interfered with his wooing.
She was no longer greatly afraid of him, for
she knew that he was on his good behavior to win
her liking.</p>
<p>Fortune favored her. For some time they had
heard the cook moving about in the kitchen. Once
she had poked her head in to know whether her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
young mistress would like the cherry pie for dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know yez had company, Miss &#8217;Lissie,&#8221;
she had apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;This gentleman will stay to dinner,&#8221; Melissy
had announced.</p>
<p>At luncheon Melissy had not eaten with him;
but at dinner it was necessary, on account of the
cook, that she sit down, too. The meal had scarce
begun when Kate came beaming in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shure, Miss &#8217;Lissie, there&#8217;s another young gentleman
at the door. It&#8217;s Mr. Bellamy. I tould him
to come right in. He&#8217;s washing his face first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Melissy rose, white as a sheet. &#8220;All right, Kate.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as soon as the cook had left the room she
turned to the outlaw. &#8220;What shall I do? What
shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Little whimsical imps of mischief shone in his
eyes. &#8220;Have him in and introduce him to your
husband, my dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go&mdash;quick. If I don&#8217;t get rid of him,
you&#8217;ll be able to slip out the back way and get to
the depot. He doesn&#8217;t know you are here.&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen sat back and gave her his easy, reckless
smile. &#8220;Guess again. Bellamy can&#8217;t drive me
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught her hands together. &#8220;Oh, go&mdash;go!
There will be trouble. You wouldn&#8217;t kill him before
my very eyes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless he makes the first play. It&#8217;s up to
him.&#8221; He laughed with the very delight of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;d as lief settle my account with him right now.
He&#8217;s meddled too much in my affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke out in a cry of distress: &#8220;You
wouldn&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve treated you fair. I could have betrayed
you, and I didn&#8217;t. Aren&#8217;t you going to play
square with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;All right. Show him in. He
won&#8217;t know me except as Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor. It
was too dark last night to see my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bellamy came into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s Jack?&#8221; Melissy asked quickly as she
caught his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good as new. And you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>The outlaw stirred uneasily in his seat. His vanity
objected to another man holding the limelight
while he was present.</p>
<p>Melissy turned. &#8220;I think you have never met
Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor, Mr. Bellamy. Lieutenant&mdash;Mr.
Bellamy.&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands. MacQueen smiled. He was
enjoying himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you, Mr. Bellamy. You and Flatray
have won the honors surely. You beat us all
to it, sir. As I rode in this mornin&#8217;, everybody was
telling how you rounded up the outlaws. Have
you caught MacQueen himself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. We have reason to believe that he
rode within ten miles of town this morning before
he cut across to the railroad. The chances are that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
he will try to board a train at some water tank in
the dark. We&#8217;re having them all watched. I came
in to telephone all stations to look out for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jack?&#8221; Melissy asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be here presently. His arm was troubling
him some, so he stopped to see the doctor. Then
he has to talk with his deputy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure he isn&#8217;t badly hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, only a scratch, he calls it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you happen on Dead Man&#8217;s Cache by accident?&#8221;
asked MacQueen with well-assumed carelessness.</p>
<p>Bellamy had no intention of giving Rosario away
to anybody. &#8220;You might call it that,&#8221; he said
evenly. &#8220;You know, I had been near there once
when I was out hunting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect to catch MacQueen?&#8221; the outlaw
asked, a faint hint of irony in his amused voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping, lieutenant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope for a heap of things we never get,&#8221;
returned the outlaw, in a gentle voice, his eyes half
shuttered behind drooping lids.</p>
<p>Melissy cut into the conversation hurriedly.
&#8220;Lieutenant O&#8217;Connor is going on the seven-five
this evening, Mr. Bellamy. He has business that
will take him away for a while. It is time we were
going. Won&#8217;t you walk down to the train with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>MacQueen swore softly under his breath, but
there was nothing he could say in protest. He knew
he could not take the girl with him. Now he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
been cheated out of his good-byes by her woman&#8217;s
wit in dragging Bellamy to the depot with them.
He could not but admire the adroitness with which
she had utilized her friend to serve her end.</p>
<p>They walked to the station three abreast, the outlaw
carrying as lightly as he could the heavy suitcase
that held his plunder. Melissy made small talk
while they waited for the train. She was very nervous,
and she was trying not to show it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time you come, lieutenant, we&#8217;ll have a fine
stone depot to show you. Mr. West has promised
to make Mesa the junction point, and we&#8217;re sure
to have a boom,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A young Mexican vaquero trailed softly behind
them, the inevitable cigarette between his lips. From
under his broad, silver-laced sombrero he looked
keenly at each of the three as he passed.</p>
<p>A whistle sounded clearly in the distance.</p>
<p>The outlaw turned to the girl beside him. &#8220;I&#8217;m
coming back some day soon. Be sure of that, Mrs.
MacQueen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The audacity of the name used, designed as it
was to stab her friend and to remind Melissy how
things stood, made the girl gasp. She looked
quickly at Bellamy and saw him crush the anger
from his face.</p>
<p>The train drew into the station. Presently the
conductor&#8217;s &#8220;All aboard!&#8221; served notice that it was
starting. The outlaw shook hands with Melissy
and then with the mine owner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye. Don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m coming back,&#8221;
he said, in a perfectly distinct, low tone.</p>
<p>And with that he swung aboard the Pullman car
with his heavy suitcase. An instant later the Mexican
vaquero pulled himself to the vestibule of the
smoking car ahead.</p>
<p>MacQueen looked back from the end of the train
at the two figures on the platform. A third figure
had joined them. It was Jack Flatray. The girl
and the sheriff were looking at each other. With
a furious oath, he turned on his heel. For the evidence
of his eyes had told him that they were lovers.</p>
<p>MacQueen passed into the coach and flung himself
down into his section discontentedly. The savor
of his adventure was gone. He had made his escape
with a large share of the plunder, in spite of spies
and posses. But in his heart he knew that he had
lost forever the girl whom he had forced to marry
him. He was still thinking about it somberly when
a figure appeared in the aisle at the end of the car.</p>
<p>Instantly the outlaw came to alert attention, and
his hand slipped to the butt of a revolver. The
figure was that of the Mexican vaquero whom he
had carelessly noted on the platform of the station.
Vigilantly his gaze covered the approaching man.
Surely in Arizona there were not two men with
that elastic tread or that lithe, supple figure.</p>
<p>His revolver flashed in the air. &#8220;Stand back,
Bucky O&#8217;Connor&mdash;or, by God, I&#8217;ll drill you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>The vaquero smiled. &#8220;Right guess, Black MacQueen.
I arrest you in the name of the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black&#8217;s revolver spat flame twice before the
ranger&#8217;s gun got into action, but the swaying of the
train caused him to stagger as he rose to his feet.</p>
<p>The first shot of Bucky&#8217;s revolver went through
the heart of the outlaw; but so relentless was the
man that, even after that, his twitching fingers emptied
the revolver. O&#8217;Connor fired only once. He
watched his opponent crumple up, fling wild shots
into the upholstery and through the roof, and sink
into the silence from which there is no awakening
on this side of the grave. Then he went forward
and looked down at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that ends Black MacQueen,&#8221; he said
quietly. &#8220;And I reckon Melissy Lee is a widow.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Jack Flatray had met O&#8217;Connor at his own office
and the two had come down to the station on the
off chance that MacQueen might try to make his
getaway from Mesa in some disguise. But as soon
as he saw Melissy the sheriff had eyes for nobody
else except the girl he loved. One sleeve of his
coat was empty, and his shoulder was bandaged.
He looked very tired and drawn; for he had ridden
hard more than sixteen hours with a painful wound.
But the moment his gaze met hers she knew that
his thoughts were all for her and her trouble.</p>
<p>His free hand went out to meet hers. She forgot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
MacQueen and all the sorrow he had brought
her. Her eyes were dewy with love and his answered
eagerly. She knew now that she would
love Jack Flatray for better or worse until death
should part them. But she knew, too, that the
shadow of MacQueen, her husband by law, was
between them.</p>
<p>Together they walked back from the depot. In
the shadow of the vines on her father&#8217;s porch they
stopped. Jack caught her hands in his and looked
down into her tired, haggard face all lit with love.
Tears were in the eyes of both.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re entitled to the truth, Jack,&#8221; she told him.
&#8220;I love you. I think I always have. And I know
I always shall. But I&#8217;m another man&#8217;s wife. It
will have to be good-bye between us, Jack,&#8221; she told
him wistfully.</p>
<p>He took her in his arms and kissed her. &#8220;You&#8217;re
my sweetheart. I&#8217;ll not give you up. Don&#8217;t
think it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with such strength, such assurance, that
she knew he would not yield without a struggle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never be anything to him&mdash;never. But he
stands between us. Don&#8217;t you see he does?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Your marriage to him is empty words.
We&#8217;ll have it annulled. It will not stand in any
court. I&#8217;ve won you and I&#8217;m going to keep you.
There&#8217;s no two ways about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She broke down and began to sob quietly in a
heartbroken fashion, while he tried to comfort her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
It was not so easy as he thought. So long as MacQueen
lived Flatray would walk in danger if she
did as he wanted her to do.</p>
<p>Neither of them knew that Bucky O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s
bullet had already annulled the marriage, that happiness
was already on the wing to them.</p>
<p>This hour was to be for their grief, the next for
their joy.</p>
